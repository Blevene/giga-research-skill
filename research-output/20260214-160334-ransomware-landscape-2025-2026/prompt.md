# Research Task: Modern Ransomware Landscape — Threat Actor Analysis (Late 2025–2026)

## Scope
Focus on the ransomware threat actor ecosystem from late 2025 through early 2026. Prioritize emerging and newly prominent groups over well-documented legacy actors. Include group profiles, notable campaigns, affiliate network evolution, and law enforcement actions. Exclude detailed malware reverse engineering and defensive playbooks — keep the lens on the actors themselves.

## Key Questions
1. Which new ransomware groups have emerged or gained prominence since mid-2025, and what distinguishes them from predecessors?
2. How has the Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) ecosystem evolved — are affiliates shifting allegiances, and what new business models have appeared?
3. What major law enforcement operations have occurred against ransomware actors in this period, and what observable impact have they had on group behavior?
4. Which industry sectors and geographies are being disproportionately targeted by emerging actors?
5. How are threat actors adapting their tactics in response to improved defenses (e.g., EDR evasion, new extortion methods beyond double extortion)?

## Depth & Focus
Analyst-report depth (5–10 pages). For each significant group, provide: origin/first observed, suspected affiliations, notable campaigns, TTPs summary, and current status. Prioritize emerging actors but contextualize them against the broader ecosystem shifts.

## Output Expectations
- Structured sections per major finding area
- Group profiles in consistent format for comparison
- Timeline of significant events where relevant
- All claims cited with sources (URLs preferred)
- Clear distinction between confirmed intelligence and analyst assessment
