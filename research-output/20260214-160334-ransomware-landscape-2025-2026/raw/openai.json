  "content": "# Modern Ransomware Landscape (Late 2025–2026): Threat Actor Ecosystem Analysis\n\n## Overview: Fragmentation and New Wave of Ransomware Actors\n\nBy late 2025, the ransomware landscape had **evolved rather than diminished**, marked by a *fragmentation* of threat actors rather than a collapse of activity ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Even%20as%20global%20law%20enforcement,grade%20efficiency)). After years dominated by a few “big name” syndicates, dozens of **smaller ransomware groups emerged in parallel** – often reusing proven tactics and code but operating independently ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=What%202025%20looked%20like%20in,the%20Ransomware%20Landscape)) ([www.neteye-blog.com](https://www.neteye-blog.com/2026/01/ransomware-double-extortion-attack-2025-overview/#:~:text=dozens%20of%20other%20gangs%20that,a%20small%20number%20of%20attacks)). This proliferation drove ransomware attacks to new heights: 2025 saw a **~32% surge in double-extortion incidents** (7,679 reported attacks vs. 5,831 in 2024) ([www.neteye-blog.com](https://www.neteye-blog.com/2026/01/ransomware-double-extortion-attack-2025-overview/#:~:text=The%20reported%20attacks%20on%20the,69)). Notably, **late May 2025 alone saw at least seven new ransomware gangs** launch leak sites and claim victims ([foresiet.com](https://foresiet.com/blog/new-ransomware-groups-emerge-in-may-2025/#:~:text=As%20of%20the%20end%20of,targeting%20and%20data%20exfiltration%20campaigns)), underscoring the rapid influx of new entrants. In short, **the once-centralized Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model splintered into many aggressive offshoots**, as criminals adapted to law enforcement pressure by rebranding and multiplying ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=Why%20it%20Matters%3A%20The%20BlackSuit,adapt%20faster%20than%20enforcement%20efforts)).\n\nSeveral **legacy groups saw declines or disruptions** during this period. Industry reports noted a *notable decline* of formerly dominant gangs like LockBit and BlackCat by mid-2025 ([flashpoint.io](https://flashpoint.io/blog/new-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-groups-to-watch-in-2025/#:~:text=In%20this%20post%20we%20take,groups%20like%20LockBit%20and%20BlackCat)), creating a vacuum eagerly filled by newcomers ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=Key%20Points)) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=like%20Clop%20can%20dramatically%20shape,ransomware%20trends)). Instead of a few large cartels, **over 80 separate ransomware leak sites were active by Q3 2025**, as smaller groups “filled the gaps left by larger ones” ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=critical%20infrastructure%20as%20a%20target)). This fragmentation made attack patterns more unpredictable, with **new groups targeting a broader array of regions and sectors** than their predecessors ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,and%20regions%20not%20traditionally%20targeted)). Double-extortion (data theft *plus* file encryption) became **standard operating procedure** for nearly all groups ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Key%20Takeaways)), and many newcomers showed a “*mature*” approach from day one – employing tactics as sophisticated as those of established players.\n\n## Profiles of Emerging Ransomware Groups (2025–2026)\n\nBelow we profile significant ransomware groups **first observed or rising to prominence in late 2025**, emphasizing their origins, affiliations, notable campaigns, tactics, and current status. These profiles illustrate how new actors both **borrow from and depart from their predecessors**.\n\n### “DevMan” – Conti Lineage, Asia-Focused Upstart\n\n**First observed:** April 2025 (closed-group RaaS).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** Descended from the Conti collective and **DragonForce** RaaS lineage ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=Emerging%20in%20April%202025%20as,proprietary%20toolset%20rather%20than%20recruiting)). DevMan operates as a **closed affiliate outfit** that has partnered across multiple RaaS platforms (primarily Qilin, also Apos and RansomHub) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=)) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=Emerging%20in%20April%202025%20as,proprietary%20toolset%20rather%20than%20recruiting)). This suggests a core team leveraging various RaaS programs rather than recruiting widely.  \n**Notable Activity:** DevMan escalated quickly – reaching ~40–50 victims by Q2 2025 and as many as **70–86 victims by Q3 2025** ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=match%20at%20L202%20increasing%20attack,Following%20June%202025%20GangExposed)). Its peak burst in May 2025 briefly put it among the top-tier groups by volume ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=surge%20to%20%2B12%20claimed%20victims,and%20RDP%20lateral%20movement%20showed)) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=increasing%20attack%20tempo%20reaching%2040,Following%20June%202025%20GangExposed)). Victims included organizations across **Asia and Africa** (over 60% in locales like Taiwan, Thailand, China, Japan, Singapore) with an expanding foothold in Europe/North America later ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=%28over%2060,wide%20distribution)). This regional focus on Asia and emerging markets sets DevMan apart from many Western-focused predecessors.  \n**Tactics:** The group developed a **proprietary toolset** and even migrated its ransomware code from C++ to Rust within months ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=Operational%20Complexity%20%20,wide%20distribution)) – reflecting agility in evading detection. Intrusions have leveraged vulnerable Internet-facing services (e.g. Microsoft Exchange, VMware ESXi) and common post-exploitation tools (PowerShell, PsExec) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=surge%20to%20%2B12%20claimed%20victims,and%20RDP%20lateral%20movement%20showed)). DevMan’s ability to propagate quickly through networks (e.g. via Windows file-sharing) was noted in local reports ([entechreview.com](https://entechreview.com/2025/07/devman-ransomware-dragonforce/#:~:text=%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AD%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B0%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9F%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A7%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%9A%2040%20%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%20,%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%88%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%9B%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%86%20%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%88%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%82%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%94%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%20%E0%B8%9C%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%8A%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%8C%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%9F%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%20Windows%20%E0%B9%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B0%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%88%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%94%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B1%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%8C%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%A1%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%97%E0%B8%B5)).  \n**Current Status:** Active into late 2025; no known takedowns. DevMan’s success in regions less targeted by traditional gangs hints at **ransomware’s globalization** – with threat actors arising outside the typical Eastern European base.\n\n### “DireWolf” – Independent RaaS with Advanced Techniques\n\n**First observed:** May 2025.  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** **No known ties to existing groups** – DireWolf is described as an entirely new threat actor with its own bespoke malware and infrastructure ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/dire-wolf#:~:text=No%20identified%20affiliations%20or%20connections,codebase%2C%20and%20separate%20financial%20operations)). It operates as a closed group (no broad affiliate program).  \n**Notable Activity:** Within weeks of appearing, DireWolf established an active leak site and had ~49 victims listed by mid-2025 ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=2)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Victim%20geography)). Reports noted its targets spanned *regulatory, logistics, and industrial sectors* ([foresiet.com](https://foresiet.com/blog/new-ransomware-groups-emerge-in-may-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L119%20DireWolf%20has,regulatory%2C%20logistics%2C%20and%20industrial%20sectors)), implying a focus on organizations where downtime is costly. Despite its low profile, the group’s **victim-specific attacks** indicated **unusual operational maturity for a newcomer** ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/dire-wolf#:~:text=First%20appearing%20May%202025%2C%20this,Curve25519%20and%20ChaCha20%20encryption%20from)).  \n**Tactics:** DireWolf employs a **custom Golang-based ransomware** with strong encryption (Curve25519 + ChaCha20) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/dire-wolf#:~:text=First%20appearing%20May%202025%2C%20this,Curve25519%20and%20ChaCha20%20encryption%20from)). The choice of Go, along with the group’s independent servers, suggests an intent to evade standard detection signatures. They execute highly tailored intrusions (rather than opportunistic mass attacks), possibly via social engineering or targeted exploits. Such a professional approach – including sound cryptography and “tight core team” operations – mirrors the playbooks of established RaaS, but without affiliating to any known cartel ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/dire-wolf#:~:text=No%20identified%20affiliations%20or%20connections,codebase%2C%20and%20separate%20financial%20operations)) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/dire-wolf#:~:text=First%20appearing%20May%202025%2C%20this,Curve25519%20and%20ChaCha20%20encryption%20from)).  \n**Current Status:** Active. DireWolf’s early success and technical sophistication signal that *new entrants can rapidly achieve “enterprise-grade” ransomware operations*, even without inheriting code from predecessors.\n\n### **“Nova” (aka RALord)** – Rebranded RaaS with Global Victims\n\n**First observed:** Late March 2025 (as “RALord”), rebranded to **Nova** by April 2025 ([redpiranha.net](https://redpiranha.net/news/threat-intelligence-report-january-20-january-26-2026#:~:text=Nova%20Ransomware%20Analysis%20Period%3A%2017,The%20group)).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** Nova is essentially a **rebrand of the RALord RaaS**. This quick renaming reflects the “identity-fluid” nature of modern ransomware gangs ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=3)) – groups frequently relaunch under new names to dodge law enforcement or reputational baggage. Nova/RALord does not appear directly linked to older franchises, but its rapid growth suggests an experienced team.  \n**Notable Activity:** As of early 2026, Nova/RALord had **over 86 victims across five continents** ([threatlabsnews.xcitium.com](https://threatlabsnews.xcitium.com/blog/from-ralord-to-nova-how-this-raas-gang-is-wreaking-havoc-worldwide/#:~:text=This%20group%2C%20which%20was%20previously,five%20continents%20by%20early%202026)) – a *remarkable expansion* within less than a year of operations. Through late 2025, it claimed dozens of organizations worldwide, ranging from a French food production firm to a Dubai government entity ([threatlabsnews.xcitium.com](https://threatlabsnews.xcitium.com/blog/from-ralord-to-nova-how-this-raas-gang-is-wreaking-havoc-worldwide/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20in%20January%202026%2C,systems%20and%20stolen%20internal%20data)), indicating *no geographic boundaries*. Nova made headlines with a series of attacks in January 2026, hitting companies in varied sectors (food manufacturing, media conglomerates, even a state air transport service) ([threatlabsnews.xcitium.com](https://threatlabsnews.xcitium.com/blog/from-ralord-to-nova-how-this-raas-gang-is-wreaking-havoc-worldwide/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20in%20January%202026%2C,systems%20and%20stolen%20internal%20data)). This global reach in a short time made Nova one of the most prolific “new” RaaS operations.  \n**Tactics:** Nova runs a classic **RaaS affiliate model**, offering its malware to partners. It relies on double extortion (data theft + encryption) and has shown flexibility in initial access vectors – ranging from credential compromise to exploiting vulnerabilities, as suggested by its diverse victim profile. Some reports note Nova’s **leak site and tooling share lineage** with earlier kits (for example, the file extension “.RALORD” in ransom notes ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=3)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=match%20at%20L172%20IOCs))), but the group continually updates its malware. Nova’s success underscores how **rebranding can rejuvenate a threat actor**, combining new recruitment with the operational know-how of its previous incarnation.  \n**Current Status:** Very active (as of Q1 2026). Nova’s persistence and growth illustrate that **criminal networks can withstand a name-change and keep “wreaking havoc worldwide”** ([threatlabsnews.xcitium.com](https://threatlabsnews.xcitium.com/blog/from-ralord-to-nova-how-this-raas-gang-is-wreaking-havoc-worldwide/#:~:text=threatlabsnews,based)).\n\n### **“Global” (aka Global Group)** – Cross-Platform Ransomware \n\n**First observed:** June 2025 (advertised as “GLOBAL GROUP” on a criminal forum) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=4%29%20Global%20)).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** Reporting suggests Global may be tied to earlier lesser-known brands **“Mamona” / “BlackLock”** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Timeline)). This implies a possible retooling or upgrade of a prior ransomware strain.  \n**Notable Activity:** Around 30+ victims were claimed in its first months ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=match%20at%20L209%20Victim%20geography)). While not among the highest-volume actors, Global stands out for its platform coverage. Victims spanned multiple countries (details are scant, but likely global given its name and intent).  \n**Tactics:** **Multi-OS capability** is Global’s hallmark – it supports Windows as well as Linux and ESXi targets out-of-the-box ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=4%29%20Global%20)). By mid-2025, having cross-platform ransomware became almost *expected* among new groups (a shift from earlier Windows-centric groups) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=BEAST%20,affiliate%20ecosystems%C2%A0remain%C2%A0resilient%20despite%20ransomware%20takedowns)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)). Global’s malware included indicators like a custom mutex (`Global\\Fxo16jmd...`) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=match%20at%20L216%20IOCs)), and the group likely emphasizes broad targeting of both corporate IT systems and servers.  \n**Current Status:** Ongoing. Global Group reflects how **“cross-platform” ransomware is becoming the default — not the exception** in 2025+ ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)), as groups aim to encrypt entire environments including Virtual Machines and Linux-based infrastructure.\n\n### **“J” Group – Niche Entrant with Mysterious Identity**\n\n**First observed:** Mid-2025 (exact origin unclear; possibly related to an older “J-Ransom” strain) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Timeline)).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** The so-called “J” ransomware group is **poorly documented**; analysts pieced together its existence from victim cases rather than hacker forum PR. Some sources indicate a ransomware variant dubbed “J-Ransom” with file extensions like `.LoveYou` was used ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Victim%20geography)), but there’s scant info on who operates it. It may represent a **small regional crew or a short-lived experiment**.  \n**Notable Activity:** Roughly 30–40 victims were tentatively attributed to “J” in 2025 ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Victim%20geography)). These incidents didn’t attract major media attention, suggesting mostly mid-sized enterprises or local targets. Victimology hints at patterns (perhaps concentration in a region or sector), but details remain sparse publicly.  \n**Tactics:** No unique tactics are known beyond standard double extortion. The lack of a known leak site or brand persona suggests “J” might simply deploy a *commodity ransomware variant* (indeed one older strain used a “LoveYou” extension) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=match%20at%20L255%20IOCs)). This underscores that not all emerging actors establish notorious blogs; some operate in shadows, perhaps selling stolen data privately or relying on intermediaries.  \n**Current Status:** Uncertain. The “J” group’s impact appears limited and it has not achieved the prominence of others on this list, making it a minor player representative of the many ephemeral ransomware operations that come and go.\n\n### **“Warlock” – State-Sponsored Exploits Meet Ransomware**\n\n**First observed:** Mid-2025 (notably active July 2025).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** Uniquely, Warlock ransomware **surfaced via nation-state adversaries**. Microsoft and others tied Warlock deployments to **China-linked hacking units (Linen Typhoon, Violet Typhoon)** exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Threat%20Intelligence%20researchers%20have,49704%20vulnerabilities)). In other words, Warlock appears to be a **ransomware tool repurposed by Chinese APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups**, blurring espionage and cybercrime lines.  \n**Notable Campaigns:** In July 2025, attackers exploited critical **SharePoint server 0-days** (CVE-2025-49704/49706) to breach multiple government and enterprise networks globally ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Timeline)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,July%207%2C%C2%A02025%C2%A0and%20ongoing%20active%20attacks)). After initial compromise, they rapidly deployed Warlock ransomware across victim environments – for example, via on-premises SharePoint servers used as beachheads ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Warlock%E2%80%99s%20relevance%20in%202025%20stems,facing%20enterprise%20software)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,July%207%2C%C2%A02025%C2%A0and%20ongoing%20active%20attacks)). Microsoft reported active Warlock attacks from July onward, and dozens of organizations (possibly more) in various countries fell victim ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Timeline)) ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Threat%20Intelligence%20researchers%20have,49704%20vulnerabilities)). Notably, some **government agencies** were affected, indicating critical targets were hit as collateral damage of this financially motivated twist on state hacking.  \n**Tactics:** The attack chain combined stealthy nation-state tactics with **“big-game” ransomware execution**. After exploiting the SharePoint flaws, the attackers installed web shells and moved laterally using tools like **Impacket and PsExec**, then **pushed the ransomware via Group Policy** to encrypt across the domain ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=They%20then%20move%20laterally%20with,Warlock%20ransomware%20across%20compromised%20systems)). These are sophisticated techniques normally seen in targeted espionage – here leveraged for ransomware deployment. Warlock’s code and affiliates are less known in criminal circles; it may be a *bespoke ransomware variant (Microsoft labels the actor cluster as Storm-2603)* used as a **“hybrid financial and espionage” tool ([blog.alphahunt.io](https://blog.alphahunt.io/storm-2603-sharepoint-zero-day-exploitation-and-warlock-ransomware-a-hybrid-financial-and-espionage-threat/#:~:text=Storm,Have%20feedback%3F%20Did%20something))**.  \n**Current Status:** Ongoing as a threat, but tightly linked to the SharePoint exploit window. Warlock’s emergence highlights a trend of **state-backed or state-tolerated actors adopting ransomware** as another weapon – potentially for profit or as disruptive cover for espionage.\n\n### **“Beast” – Resilient Multi-Platform RaaS**\n\n**First observed:** 2022 (but **surged in visibility in 2025**).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** Beast is a *RaaS platform that has been around for a few years*, relaunched or heavily promoted in 2024. It’s an example of a ransomware brand that quietly persisted and then **gained traction amid the 2025 upheavals** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=BEAST%20,affiliate%20ecosystems%C2%A0remain%C2%A0resilient%20despite%20ransomware%20takedowns)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,builder%E2%80%9D%20promoted%20by%20August%202024)). Some sources indicated Beast’s operators offered an **“offline builder” to affiliates by Aug 2024**, suggesting a mature service model ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,builder%E2%80%9D%20promoted%20by%20August%202024)).  \n**Notable Activity:** Beast was credited with dozens of attacks (~46 known victims by late 2025) across **the US, Europe, Asia, and Latin America** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Victim%20geography)). Rather than a dramatic new entry, Beast’s significance in 2025 was as a **steady, growing RaaS** filling the void left by dismantled groups. It reinforced that affiliate programs can survive law enforcement disruptions and continue to thrive.  \n**Tactics:** Beast’s malware boasts full **cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, VMware ESXi)** and is shared among affiliates ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=BEAST%20,affiliate%20ecosystems%C2%A0remain%C2%A0resilient%20despite%20ransomware%20takedowns)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)). Common intrusion vectors include **compromised RDP credentials, SMB vulnerability exploitation, and other opportunistic methods** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=BEAST%20,affiliate%20ecosystems%C2%A0remain%C2%A0resilient%20despite%20ransomware%20takedowns)). In essence, Beast sticks to the **“tried-and-true” playbook** of big RaaS operations: broad targeting, multi-extortion, and constant feature updates to its code.  \n**Current Status:** Active. Beast’s sustained success into 2025 led researchers to conclude that **the RaaS model remains “resilient and easily adaptable” despite takedowns ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=has%20been%20associated%20with%20common,affiliate%20ecosystems%C2%A0remain%C2%A0resilient%20despite%20ransomware%20takedowns)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Cyble%C2%A0Watch%3A%C2%A0BEAST%C2%A0shows%C2%A0RaaS%20models%20are%20sustainable%20and,easily%20adaptable))**. In many ways, Beast is a “new” prominent group only because others fell away – demonstrating the *staying power* of well-run RaaS enterprises.\n\n### **“Sinobi” – Stealthy Intruder with Lynx Ties**\n\n**First observed:** Mid-2025.  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** **Believed to be a rebrand or offshoot of the earlier Lynx ransomware ecosystem** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Sinobi%C2%A0appears%20to%C2%A0operate%C2%A0as%20either%20a%20rebrand,prioritizing%20operational%20control%20before%20monetization)). Sinobi’s operators exhibit a level of discipline and tradecraft that suggests prior experience (possibly former Lynx affiliates or developers).  \n**Notable Activity:** In just a few months of 2025, Sinobi amassed ~40 known victims (as of September 2025) and continued steadily thereafter ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=%2A%20Sinobi%E2%80%99s%C2%A0ransomware%20brand%C2%A0emerged%C2%A0in%20mid,disciplined%20intrusions%20and%20operational%20maturity)). By late 2025 it had impacted an estimated **138 organizations** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Victim%20Geography)) – a large tally that elevated it into a major actor. Victims are **primarily in the United States** (and allied Western countries) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)), focusing on sectors like *manufacturing and other mid-to-large businesses* ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,large%20business%20verticals)). This suggests Sinobi selectively pursues companies with substantial revenue impact.  \n**Tactics:** True to its Lynx heritage, Sinobi is **“enterprise-aware”** and emphasizes stealth and control before monetization ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Sinobi%C2%A0appears%20to%C2%A0operate%C2%A0as%20either%20a%20rebrand,prioritizing%20operational%20control%20before%20monetization)). Intrusions often begin with **stolen VPN credentials** or other identity compromise ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Sinobi%C2%A0appears%20to%C2%A0operate%C2%A0as%20either%20a%20rebrand,prioritizing%20operational%20control%20before%20monetization)), followed by deliberate **defense evasion and data exfiltration prior to encryption**. The ransomware itself uses robust cryptography (Curve25519 + AES-CTR) and applies a straightforward `.SINOBI` extension with a simple `README.txt` ransom note ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)). Sinobi’s leak-site behavior and infrastructure show overlaps with Lynx, reinforcing the rebrand theory ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=reverse%20engineering%20%2F%20attribution%20comparison%29)). Overall, this group acts more like a seasoned APT-style attacker (e.g. careful lateral movement, staging of data) that added ransomware to its toolkit.  \n**Current Status:** Active and growing. Sinobi demonstrates that **some emerging groups operate with “deliberate tradecraft” more typical of nation-state hackers** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Sinobi%C2%A0appears%20to%C2%A0operate%C2%A0as%20either%20a%20rebrand,prioritizing%20operational%20control%20before%20monetization)). Its success also highlights that **identity security failures (like leaked credentials) remain a top ransomware entry point ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,Lynx%20DLS%20and%20ecosystem%20traits))** – a weakness it will continue to exploit in 2026.\n\n### **“NightSpire” – Data Leak Extortionist Turned Encryptor**\n\n**First observed:** Early 2025 (leak site live by March 12, 2025) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Timeline)).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** Believed to have started as a **data extortion group** (no proprietary malware at first). NightSpire’s operators initially focused on stealing data and pressuring victims with leak threats, akin to groups like RansomHouse or industrial spy groups. It does not appear directly linked to a prior RaaS brand, and may have been a small crew feeling out the market.  \n**Notable Activity:** NightSpire claimed at least **90+ victims by late 2025** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Victim%20Geography)), across a broad set of industries – from healthcare and education to manufacturing, government, retail, and logistics ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)). One early confirmed victim was a Japanese manufacturer (Nippon Ceramic in April 2025) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,2025%20activity)), showing the group had global reach. The wide sector spread implies opportunistic targeting, possibly via extortion demands to any company with sensitive data.  \n**Tactics:** Unusually, NightSpire **evolved its tactics mid-stream**: in early operations it did *not* encrypt files, relying only on data theft and threats to leak (single-extortion) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=NightSpire%C2%A0is%20notable%20for%20its%20evolution,site%20exposure)). By later 2025, the group pivoted to full **double-extortion – adding ransomware encryption on top of data theft** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,site%20since%2012%20March%202025)). This shift affirmed that **encryption remains the most forceful way to compel payment**, as pure data extortion often isn’t enough ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=NightSpire%C2%A0is%20notable%20for%20its%20evolution,site%20exposure)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=March%202025)). NightSpire uses standard communications channels like ProtonMail/OnionMail and even Telegram for negotiations ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=IOCs%20%2F%20Technical%20Indicators)). There are also known aliases of the operators (e.g. `xdragon128`, `Cuteliyuan`) linking NightSpire to *overlapping cybercriminal ecosystems* ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,indicator%20of%20actor%20infrastructure)) – indicating the individuals may be involved in multiple schemes.  \n**Current Status:** Active. NightSpire’s trajectory from “leaks-only” to full ransomware by late 2025 exemplifies how **new extortion groups adapt to maximize profits** – often ending up embracing the full ransomware toolkit to increase victim pressure ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Cyble%C2%A0Watch%3A%C2%A0Expect%20more%20%E2%80%9Cexfil,encryption%20for%20higher%20conversion%20rates)).\n\n### **“The Gentlemen” – Sophisticated ‘Newcomers’ with Seasoned Tactics**\n\n**First observed:** Summer 2025 (around July 2025) ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=First%20observed%20in%20July%202025%2C,new%2C%20highly%20capable%20ransomware%20variants)).  \n**Origins & Affiliations:** Despite being new in 2025, *The Gentlemen* behave like veteran operators. Researchers suspect this group is either a **rebranding of an older crew or a union of experienced affiliates** given its advanced methods ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=These%20%E2%80%98Gentlemen%E2%80%99%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20Gentle%3A%20Rapidly,%E2%80%9CThe%20Gentlemen%E2%80%9D%20has%20emerged%20as)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=The%20Gentlemen%C2%A0emerged%C2%A0as%20one%20of%20the,or%20recruitment%20of%20experienced%20affiliates)). Early forum chatter showed the group’s members exploring other RaaS programs (even attempting to access Qilin’s affiliate panels) before launching their own service ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=Cybereason%E2%80%99s%20analysis%20shows%20that%20The,they%20studied%20the%20market%20first)). This deliberate entry suggests a **well-planned operation rather than a spontaneous rookie group**.  \n**Notable Activity:** Within months, The Gentlemen amassed a significant victim count – **48 victims listed on its leak site by late 2025 ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=First%20observed%20in%20July%202025%2C,new%2C%20highly%20capable%20ransomware%20variants))**, across more than a dozen countries ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=The%20Gentlemen%C2%A0emerged%C2%A0as%20one%20of%20the,or%20recruitment%20of%20experienced%20affiliates)). They rapidly gained a reputation as one of *2025’s most dangerous threats*. High-profile incidents (reported by Cybereason and others) showed The Gentlemen hitting large enterprises and critical sectors, drawing considerable attention by Q4 2025 ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=These%20%E2%80%98Gentlemen%E2%80%99%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20Gentle%3A%20Rapidly,%E2%80%9CThe%20Gentlemen%E2%80%9D%20has%20emerged%20as)). Their broad geographic reach and impact underscored that they were not confined to any niche.  \n**Tactics:** The Gentlemen’s playbook **mimics top-tier RaaS operations**. They utilize dual-extortion and even triple-extortion techniques, **cross-platform lockers for Windows/Linux/ESXi**, and demonstrate “automated persistence [and] flexible propagation” within victim networks ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=ransomware%20techniques%20with%20RaaS%20features%2C,and%20evade%20basic%20defenses%20quickly)). Notably, they abuse legitimate admin tools (e.g. Windows Group Policy modifications, built-in scripting) to deploy ransomware enterprise-wide ([ransomnews.online](https://ransomnews.online/hub/ransomnews-thegentlemen.html#:~:text=note%3A%20%60README,Remote%20access%3A%20AnyDesk%2C%20compromised%20RDP)) ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=These%20%E2%80%98Gentlemen%E2%80%99%20Aren%E2%80%99t%20Gentle%3A%20Rapidly,%E2%80%9CThe%20Gentlemen%E2%80%9D%20has%20emerged%20as)). They also employ advanced anti-defense measures, such as using vulnerable drivers to kill antivirus – for example, dropping tools like `All.exe` and `Allpatch2.exe` that exploit the *ThrottleStop* driver vulnerability to disable endpoint security ([ransomnews.online](https://ransomnews.online/hub/ransomnews-thegentlemen.html#:~:text=HUB%20%40%20ransomNews%20,Remote%20access%3A%20AnyDesk%2C%20compromised%20RDP)). All these indicate a **“highly coordinated ecosystem”** that *borrows proven tactics from prior RaaS giants* ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Gentlemen%20ransomware%20group%20relies,Research%20Lead%20at%20Picus%20Security)). Affiliates (or internal operators) receive support akin to a professional service, enabling rapid and widespread attacks. As one security lead noted, The Gentlemen *“studied the market first”* and built their platform on “tried-and-true tactics” from successful predecessors ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CThe%20Gentlemen%20ransomware%20group%20relies,Research%20Lead%20at%20Picus%20Security)) ([www.esecurityplanet.com](https://www.esecurityplanet.com/threats/these-gentlemen-arent-gentle-rapidly-evolving-ransomware-threat/#:~:text=Cybereason%E2%80%99s%20analysis%20shows%20that%20The,they%20studied%20the%20market%20first)).  \n**Current Status:** Active and expanding. The Gentlemen appear to be thriving into 2026. Their emergence shows how **a new group can appear “operationally mature” from the start ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=The%20Gentlemen%C2%A0emerged%C2%A0as%20one%20of%20the,or%20recruitment%20of%20experienced%20affiliates))** – likely by leveraging seasoned cybercriminal talent. It also reflects the trend of **RaaS actors rebranding under new names to hide in plain sight**, without losing effectiveness.\n\n**(The above profiles represent a selection of prominent new groups; many other smaller ransomware entities also appeared in late 2025, often operating briefly with only a handful of victims ([www.neteye-blog.com](https://www.neteye-blog.com/2026/01/ransomware-double-extortion-attack-2025-overview/#:~:text=dozens%20of%20other%20gangs%20that,a%20small%20number%20of%20attacks)). The focus here is on those with notable impact or novel characteristics.)*\n\n## Evolution of the RaaS Ecosystem: Affiliates, Rebrands, and Business Models\n\nLate 2025’s ransomware boom was driven by shifts in the **Ransomware-as-a-Service economy**. The RaaS model – where developers lease ransomware to affiliates for a revenue share – remained central, but it **fragmented and evolved in key ways**:\n\n- **Affiliate Migration and Rebranding:** As big-name RaaS groups fell or faded, **affiliates flocked to new platforms or relaunched under new banners**. For example, when the Conti syndicate imploded in 2022, its members splintered into offshoots (e.g. Quantum, Royal) that eventually led to **BlackSuit by 2024 ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=BlackSuit%20ransomware%20group%20emerged%20from,healthcare%2C%20and%20construction%20sectors%20globally))**. After **BlackSuit was dismantled in mid-2025, its members swiftly dispersed to other operations – including a newly emerging “Chaos” ransomware group – essentially **reconstituting under a new name** ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=Why%20it%20Matters%3A%20The%20BlackSuit,adapt%20faster%20than%20enforcement%20efforts)). This demonstrates how affiliates **shift allegiances fluidly**: as one operation becomes untenable, they join or form another with minimal downtime. Similarly, the RALord→Nova rebranding in 2025 is a case where the same RaaS offering simply **adopted a new moniker to reset its reputation** ([redpiranha.net](https://redpiranha.net/news/threat-intelligence-report-january-20-january-26-2026#:~:text=Nova%20Ransomware%20Analysis%20Period%3A%2017,The%20group)). These examples show that **criminal affiliate networks are highly resilient – they adapt faster than enforcement efforts** ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=ransomware%20group%20resilience%20and%20rebranding,adapt%20faster%20than%20enforcement%20efforts)). \n\n- **Rise of Smaller, Agile RaaS Operations:** The **“big cartel” era** (dominated by LockBit, REvil, etc.) gave way to a **crowded market of mid-sized RaaS groups**. By Q3 2025, a record 81 separate ransomware leak sites were tracked ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=critical%20infrastructure%20as%20a%20target)). Many of these new RaaS offerings run lean operations – some are essentially **one or two core developers with a handful of affiliates**. They often recruit in closed forums or inherit established affiliate circles from previous groups. This has led to a more unpredictable threat landscape: **“the fracturing of established groups and emergence of new players increases unpredictability”** in whom or what may be targeted ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=Despite%20victimology%20trends%2C%20ransomware%20is,theft%2C%20encryption%2C%20and%20reputational%20damage)). **Dozens of gangs now operate for only a few months** – hitting a set of victims then vanishing or rebranding ([www.neteye-blog.com](https://www.neteye-blog.com/2026/01/ransomware-double-extortion-attack-2025-overview/#:~:text=dozens%20of%20other%20gangs%20that,a%20small%20number%20of%20attacks)). This churn makes it harder for defenders to pin down top threats, as the leaderboard is constantly in flux.\n\n- **New RaaS Entrants from Unconventional Backgrounds:** We’ve seen threat actors from **diverse geographies and skill sets** launching RaaS services. For instance, the **Scattered Spider** collective – known for social engineering telecom and tech firms – announced plans in Q3 2025 to launch “**ShinySp1d3r RaaS**,” *the first English-speaking actor led ransomware service* ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,critical%20infrastructure%20as%20a%20target)) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,speaking%20cybercriminals)). This is notable because most RaaS have been run by Russian-speaking or Eastern European groups; Scattered Spider’s move signals **Western actors entering the RaaS market**, likely bringing a different approach (e.g. more emphasis on phishing/SIM-swapping for initial access, given their background). Even **former security professionals** got involved – an extreme case saw two US cybersecurity consultants running a BlackCat affiliate operation in 2023, an endeavor for which they pled guilty in 2025 ([www.itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/security/cyber-crime/cybersecurity-experts-face-20-years-in-prison-following-ransomware-campaign#:~:text=2026,Goldberg%2C%20an)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/u-s-cybersecurity-experts-plead-guilty-for-ransomware-attacks-face-20-years-in-prison-each-group-demanded-up-to-usd10-million-from-each-victim#:~:text=2025,Tyler%20Martin%20were%20formerly%20employed)). All of this points to **RaaS “democratization”** – the barrier to running a ransomware gang has lowered, with code, infrastructure, and playbooks readily available to those with criminal intent.\n\n- **RaaS Business Model Innovations:** The core model (developers taking a cut of affiliate ransom payments) persisted, but **some groups experimented with new schemes**:\n  - A few groups adopted a **pure extortion model (no encryption)** – essentially turning ransomware attacks into data theft and shakedown. For example, **World Leaks (formerly “Hunter’s International”)** would steal sensitive data and demand ransom *without encrypting files*, simply threatening disclosure ([flashpoint.io](https://flashpoint.io/blog/new-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-groups-to-watch-in-2025/#:~:text=1)). **RansomHub** (an established group) was also observed at times ransoming data without deploying crypto-malware ([flashpoint.io](https://flashpoint.io/blog/new-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-groups-to-watch-in-2025/#:~:text=1)). This approach can lower the technical bar and stealthily avoid some backup protections, though it often yields less leverage than encryption.\n  - **Hybrid extortion marketplaces:** Some actors set up portals to *auction stolen data* or pressured victims by attempting to sell data to competitors. While the traditional double-extortion leak sites publish data if unpaid, emerging twists included offering data to the highest bidder if the victim wouldn’t pay. This effectively monetizes breaches via third parties and adds pressure on victims to pay up or see others obtain their data. (One 2023 example was the group **Ransomed.vc**, which tried framing ransom demands as “fines” and claimed to auction data, blending extortion with a faux-legal spin – a trend that carried into 2025 with others adopting similar posturing).\n  - **Service Differentiation:** New RaaS groups tried to lure affiliates by changing **revenue sharing or target rules**. For instance, LockBit (a legacy player feeling competition) launched a revamped **“LockBit 5.0” affiliate program in late 2025**, advertising more permissive rules – *affiliates were now allowed to attack sectors previously off-limits* ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,limits%20under%20RaaS%20rules)) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=LockBit%205,targets%20unless%20an%20agreement%20is)). By authorizing critical infrastructure or healthcare targets (once taboo under many RaaS codes of conduct), LockBit aimed to attract affiliates willing to be more aggressive ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,critical%20infrastructure%20as%20a%20target)) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L380%20Scattered%20Spider%E2%80%99s,groups%20highlights%20the%20growing%20sophistication)). This controversial move was in part “retaliation” for law enforcement heat and an attempt to maintain dominance by any means ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L380%20Scattered%20Spider%E2%80%99s,groups%20highlights%20the%20growing%20sophistication)). It highlights that **RaaS “terms of service” can change over time** – whether to improve ethical perceptions or, conversely, to remove restrictions to maximize illicit profits.\n\n- **Multiple Affiliations and Code-Sharing:** Some threat actors no longer stick to one RaaS program at a time – **“multi-affiliate” criminals operate across RaaS platforms** concurrently ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=)). For example, the DevMan group was noted to participate in several affiliate schemes (Qilin, DragonForce, etc.) simultaneously ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=)), essentially acting as “free agent” hackers. This flexibility means the same individuals might carry techniques from one service to another, and even **reuse or share ransomware source code**. Indeed, leaked source code from older ransomware (like Babuk’s code leaked in 2021, LockBit’s builder leaked in 2022) has seeded new variants. 2025 saw instances of code leaks/auctions – e.g., the **“VanHelsing” RaaS source code was leaked and put up for sale in May 2025** ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/blog/top-ransomware-groups-may-2025-safepay-devman-rise/#:~:text=Top%20Ransomware%20Groups%20Of%20May,the%20full%20codebase%2C%20admin%20web)) – which likely spawned copycat groups in following months. In sum, the ecosystem operates not as siloed groups but as an **interconnected underworld**: affiliates hop between services; code and infrastructure are traded; and alliances or feuds (“turf wars”) can erupt between rival gangs ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/hacker-turf-war-unfolding-as-russian-dragonforce-ransomware-gang-drama-could-lead-to-double-extortionions-making-life-even-worse-for-potential-victims#:~:text=2025,the%20latter%20expanded%20its%20services)) ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/ransomware-gangs-are-now-expanding-to-physical-threats-in-the-real-world#:~:text=2025,threats%20to%20CEOs%2C%20rising%20to)).\n\n**Analyst Assessment:** The RaaS ecosystem in late 2025 exhibits **highly fluid allegiances and rapid innovation** in criminal business models. Confirmed intelligence shows many groups rebranding or regrouping after setbacks ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=ransomware%20group%20resilience%20and%20rebranding,adapt%20faster%20than%20enforcement%20efforts)). It is assessed that this fragmentation will continue into 2026, with smaller agile groups leveraging a mix of open sharing (code, leak sites) and closed partnerships. The **marketplace for ransomware affiliates has become competitive**, potentially driving gangs to offer bigger revenue cuts, bespoke malware features, or fewer scruples about targets to recruit top hackers. From a defender perspective, this means **ransomware threats are more distributed and unpredictable than ever**, as any breach could involve one of dozens of possible groups, each with slightly variant tooling but equally destructive intent.\n\n## Law Enforcement Crackdowns and Their Impact\n\n**Late 2025 through early 2026 saw several high-profile law enforcement operations** targeting ransomware actors. These efforts spanned arrests, infrastructure seizures, and even international policy initiatives (like sanctions and bounties). Below are major actions and observed impacts:\n\n- **Takedown of 8Base Ransomware (February 2025):** In an operation coordinated by Europol and Thai police, authorities **arrested four suspected leaders of the 8Base ransomware group and seized its leak site servers** ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=The%20Thai%20police%20has%20arrested,approximately%20%2416%20million%20from%201%2C000)) ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=The%20takedown%20notice%20on%20the,8Base%20leak%20site)). 8Base had been a prolific group in 2023, known for attacking over 1,000 mostly small-to-mid-sized businesses (often using Phobos ransomware code) and stealing around $16 million ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=The%20Thai%20police%20has%20arrested,approximately%20%2416%20million%20from%201%2C000)). The arrested individuals were Russian nationals operating out of Thailand ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=The%20takedown%20notice%20on%20the,8Base%20leak%20site)) – a reminder that many ransomware bosses vacation or hide in countries from which extradition is possible. The **impact:** 8Base’s operations ceased with the arrests; its activity had already declined into 2024 ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=match%20at%20L62%20The%208Base,its%20activity%20declined%20in%202024)), and this bust eliminated one threat actor. However, the underlying **Phobos ransomware toolkit remained available**, and other affiliates using Phobos continued under different names ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=The%20Phobos%20%E2%80%93%208Base%20connection)) ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=match%20at%20L56%20%E2%80%9CTaking%20advantage,data%20but%20also%20threatening%20to)). In essence, law enforcement took out a specific crew, but the broader pool of ransomware tools and actors persisted.\n\n- **Operation “Duck Hunt” against Qakbot (August 2023):** *[Preceding the main timeframe but significant]* The FBI and international partners dismantled the Qakbot botnet in 2023, removing a major initial access vector for many ransomware gangs. This operation neutralized Qakbot malware on hundreds of thousands of computers and seized its C2 infrastructure. **Impact:** Qakbot had been a key delivery mechanism for ransomware like Conti, ProLock, Egregor, and others. Its elimination in late 2023 forced ransomware affiliates to rely more on other infection routes (e.g., Cobalt Strike, IcedID trojans, or new phishing campaigns). By 2025, some actors compensated by ramping up **exploitation of software vulnerabilities** (as Clop did with file transfer software exploits ([www.neteye-blog.com](https://www.neteye-blog.com/2026/01/ransomware-double-extortion-attack-2025-overview/#:~:text=Image))) and by developing their own malware loaders. In short, law enforcement removed one piece of the puzzle, but adversaries adjusted tactics to fill the gap.\n\n- **Hive Ransomware Takedown (January 2023):** *[Also prior to mid-2025, but sets context]* The U.S. DOJ (with EU support) infiltrated and dismantled the Hive ransomware operation, even obtaining decryption keys to quietly help victims for months ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=ransomware%20group%20resilience%20and%20rebranding,adapt%20faster%20than%20enforcement%20efforts)). While outside our core period, **Hive’s takedown foreshadowed trends**: after Hive went down, its affiliates simply moved to other RaaS groups like Royal, BlackCat, etc. By late 2025, ***every major takedown was met with a ransomware “hydra” effect*** – cut off one head, and multiple new ones emerge.\n\n- **BlackSuit Ransomware Dismantled – Operation Checkmate (July/August 2025):** This was a marquee success. In a coordinated strike dubbed **Operation “Checkmate”**, U.S. and international agencies **seized BlackSuit’s servers, websites, and ~$1 million in cryptocurrency** ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/08/12/doj-blacksuit-ransomware-cryptocurrency-seizure#:~:text=Feds%20take%20down%20BlackSuit%20ransomware,gang%2C%20seize%20%241M%20in%20crypto)). BlackSuit was revealed as a successor to the Conti>Quantum>Royal lineage, responsible for over **184 victims and $500+ million in ransom demands** up to 2025 ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=Cyber%20News%20Centre%27s%20cyber%20update,500%20million%20in%20extortion%20demands)) ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=BlackSuit%20ransomware%20group%20emerged%20from,healthcare%2C%20and%20construction%20sectors%20globally)). It had hit organizations in manufacturing, education, health care, construction, and more ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=BlackSuit%20ransomware%20group%20emerged%20from,healthcare%2C%20and%20construction%20sectors%20globally)). The impact of this takedown was **mixed**: On one hand, it demonstrated unprecedented international cooperation and removed a top threat (BlackSuit’s leak site was shown seized by law enforcement banners). On the other hand, **the disruption was only temporary** – as noted, BlackSuit’s operators **“had already dispersed to other operations including INC ransomware and the emerging Chaos group” ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=ransomware%20group%20resilience%20and%20rebranding,adapt%20faster%20than%20enforcement%20efforts))**. Indeed, within weeks, a new group (informally called *Chaos*) appeared, indicating that the core criminals remained active under a fresh guise ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=ransomware%20group%20resilience%20and%20rebranding,adapt%20faster%20than%20enforcement%20efforts)). The BlackSuit case highlighted both the **geopolitical challenge** (the group had Russian origins, beyond immediate reach of Western law) and the **resilience of these syndicates**. Law enforcement emphasized that while the takedown prevented an estimated $500 million in potential extortion, **the long-term impact was limited** by rapid reorganization of the perpetrators ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=The%20operation%27s%20success%20in%20disrupting,criminal%20reorganization%20under%20new%20banners)). Still, Operation Checkmate was a moral victory and provided intelligence riches (victim lists, possibly ransomware source code, etc.) that could aid future cases.\n\n- **Arrests and Bounties for Ransomware Kingpins:** In September 2025, a notable development was the U.S. DOJ unsealing charges and announcing an **$11 million reward for a Ukrainian national, Volodymyr Tymoshchuk (alias “deadface”/“farnetwork”)**, suspected of orchestrating major ransomware attacks ([www.pcgamer.com](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/us-doj-puts-usd11-million-bounty-on-ransomware-king-allegedly-responsible-for-stealing-usd18-billion/#:~:text=2025,is%20accused%20of%20orchestrating%20ransomware)). He was linked to the older **LockerGoga** ransomware and possibly other variants ([hackread.com](https://hackread.com/lockergoga-ransomware-eu-most-wanted-list-doj-reward/#:~:text=LockerGoga%20Ransomware%20Admin%20on%20EU,September%2016%2C%202025%202%20minute)). Europol added him to the EU’s “Most Wanted” list as well ([databreaches.net](https://databreaches.net/2025/09/16/new-fugitive-uploaded-to-eu-most-wanted-list-for-major-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=New%20fugitive%20uploaded%20to%20EU,The%20individual%2C%20a%20Ukrainian)). This move shows authorities pivoting to a strategy of *“wanted” cybercriminal bounties*, hoping to pressure countries like Russia or Ukraine to act, or to catch these individuals if they travel. Additionally, **indictments of known ransomware actors** continued – for example, the U.S. had earlier indicted Russians allegedly behind Hive, REvil, and LockBit (even if they remain at large). The **impact** of such legal actions is mostly symbolic but important: it restricts suspects’ international travel and signals that intelligence has unmasked their identities. The $11M FBI bounty underscores how highly authorities value disrupting top-tier operators – it effectively paints a target on the suspect’s back, possibly sowing mistrust within criminal circles.\n\n- **Insider Arrests (December 2025):** A surprising angle was the guilty plea of two U.S. men who were **insiders-turned-ransomware-affiliates**, extorting companies with ALPHV/BlackCat in 2023 ([www.itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/security/cyber-crime/cybersecurity-experts-face-20-years-in-prison-following-ransomware-campaign#:~:text=2026,Goldberg%2C%20an)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/u-s-cybersecurity-experts-plead-guilty-for-ransomware-attacks-face-20-years-in-prison-each-group-demanded-up-to-usd10-million-from-each-victim#:~:text=2025,Tyler%20Martin%20were%20formerly%20employed)). Their arrest and impending 20-year sentences send a message that **even “locals” and tech insiders are not immune to prosecution**. These cases are rare (most ransomware crews operate from jurisdictions with limited extradition), but they demonstrate law enforcement’s reach when suspects reside in law-abiding countries or make operational mistakes. The impact here is deterrence: it shows that participants in RaaS, even as affiliates, face serious jail time if caught. It may also reveal investigative clues (since such insiders might cooperate and provide details on how they interfaced with foreign RaaS operators).\n\n- **Interpol Global Crackdowns (2025):** Interpol led broad cybercrime sweeps such as **Operation “Serengeti 2.0” (June–Aug 2025)** and **Operation “Sentinel” (Oct–Nov 2025)**, focusing on Africa and beyond ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/057fee9214a008eb2829a672b10e69b0#:~:text=2025,effort%20which%20targeted%20various%20cybercrimes)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/interpol-led-cybercrime-crackdown-results-in-574-arrests-in-19-african-nations-decrypts-six-ransomware-variants-operation-sentinel-disrupts-rings-that-caused-usd21-million-in-losses-recovers-usd3-million#:~:text=African%20nations%2C%20decrypts%20six%20ransomware,digital%20extortion%2C%20and%20ransomware)). These resulted in hundreds – even thousands – of arrests (though mostly for online fraud like BEC, romance scams, etc., rather than big ransomware bosses) ([theweek.com](https://theweek.com/world-news/africa-interpol-sting-cybercrime-sextortion#:~:text=2025,initiative%20identified%20nearly%201%2C500%20victims)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/interpol-led-cybercrime-crackdown-results-in-574-arrests-in-19-african-nations-decrypts-six-ransomware-variants-operation-sentinel-disrupts-rings-that-caused-usd21-million-in-losses-recovers-usd3-million#:~:text=African%20nations%2C%20decrypts%20six%20ransomware,digital%20extortion%2C%20and%20ransomware)). Notably, Operation Sentinel claimed **574 arrests across 19 African nations and the takedown of several cybercriminal rings, with six ransomware variants decrypted and $3 million recovered** ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/interpol-led-cybercrime-crackdown-results-in-574-arrests-in-19-african-nations-decrypts-six-ransomware-variants-operation-sentinel-disrupts-rings-that-caused-usd21-million-in-losses-recovers-usd3-million#:~:text=African%20nations%2C%20decrypts%20six%20ransomware,digital%20extortion%2C%20and%20ransomware)). The decryptions likely refer to law enforcement obtaining decryption keys for certain strains (potentially through server seizures or cooperation), which would help current victims recover without paying. The **impact:** While these sweeps likely disrupted local cyber gangs and nascent ransomware crews, they did not directly hit the major Russia-based syndicates. However, they demonstrate the **globalization of enforcement** – even regions not typically associated with ransomware hubs are cracking down, which could deter ransomware hosting or money laundering operations in those locales.\n\n- **Sanctions and Financial Actions:** The U.S. and allies in 2025 continued to wield sanctions as a tool – e.g., sanctioning cryptocurrency exchanges or mixers (like Tornado Cash, ChipMixer) used by ransomware groups to launder proceeds. They also sanctioned individuals linked to ransomware (which freezes any of their assets in Western reach). While these measures make it harder for gangs to cash out or spend their funds, **determined actors found workarounds** (different crypto laundering methods, new mixers, or simply enjoying safe harbor in Russia). Still, the pressure increased the **cost and risk of moving ransom payments**, and may have contributed to a slight shift toward **victims refusing to pay** (knowing payment could violate sanctions if the gang is listed).\n\n**Observed Impact on Ransomware Actor Behavior:** Despite these enforcement wins, **ransomware activity remained high or even grew in 2025**. One report found the number of victims posted to leak sites globally **rose from ~5,400 in 2024 to ~7,600 in 2025** ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/takedowns-and-arrests-didnt-slow-down-ransomware-in-2025#:~:text=2026,victims%20rose%20from%20approximately%205%2C400)). This indicates that **criminals largely adapted rather than desisted**. Some behavioral changes attributable to the crackdown environment include:\n\n- **Faster Rebranding**: Groups now frequently **preempt law enforcement by rebranding** proactively. For example, after a major leak or suspicion of infiltration, gangs might shut down their site and reappear under a new name within weeks. (*e.g.* the Clop gang briefly went quiet after high-profile exploits, then returned; LockBit similarly retooled to new versions). The goal is to confuse attribution and make it harder for investigators to track them.\n\n- **Targets Retaliation**: In response to governments’ offensive measures, some gangs became more brazen in targeting. For instance, LockBit’s decision to *explicitly allow critical infrastructure targeting in its affiliate rules* was seen as **retaliation for increased law enforcement focus** ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L380%20Scattered%20Spider%E2%80%99s,groups%20highlights%20the%20growing%20sophistication)). Removing “protected” status from hospitals or government agencies upped the ante – effectively saying *“if you come after us, we won’t hold back either.”* This chilling development could heighten the real-world impacts of ransomware incidents.\n\n- **Geographic Shifts & Geopolitics**: Actors clearly avoid operating in countries likely to arrest them. Notably, **Russia and allied territories remain safe havens** – none of the major Russian suspects have been extradited. In some cases, Russian law enforcement itself took minor action (there were reports in early 2022 of FSB arrests of some REvil members, possibly for show). By late 2025, **ransomware groups started explicitly countering Western efforts** – for example, the LockBit and ALPHV crews discussed sharing data or aligning as a “cartel” against common enemies. Law enforcement successes in places like Thailand (8Base) and Turkey/Latvia (where a Conti affiliate was arrested in 2022) showed criminals that travel and OPSEC mistakes are their Achilles heel. As a result, top actors likely doubled down on staying within friendly borders or using deep anonymity on forums.\n\nIn summary, **law enforcement operations in this period delivered tactical victories but did not curb the overall ransomware trend** ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/takedowns-and-arrests-didnt-slow-down-ransomware-in-2025#:~:text=2026,victims%20rose%20from%20approximately%205%2C400)). Confirmed incidents actually rose, and threat actors adapted by regrouping quickly and in some cases escalating their tactics. The takedowns did force less-dedicated players out and raised the cost of doing business for criminals (e.g., losing their infrastructure or crypto funds). The long-game impact is also cumulative: each bust yields intelligence, decryptors, and deterrence that can slowly undermine the ecosystem. However, as of early 2026, ransomware groups continue to proliferate and **behave more defiantly in the face of crackdowns**, requiring sustained and coordinated global pressure.\n\n## Targeted Sectors and Geographies: Who Are the Victims?\n\n**Emerging ransomware actors in 2025–26 have largely continued the trend of targeting wealthier nations and essential industries**, though fragmentation has led to some broadening of victim demographics. Key patterns include:\n\n- **Continued Focus on the U.S. and Western Countries:** The United States remains by far the **most targeted country**, accounting for roughly *two-thirds of ransomware victims posted* on leak sites in Q2 2025 ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=The%20US%20remains%20the%20most,regulations%2C%20which%20increase%20the%20likelihood)). This is consistent with previous years – the sheer number of large organizations and their ability to pay drives this focus ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=The%20US%20remains%20the%20most,is%20exploiting%20vulnerabilities%20in%20German)). Newer groups have not strayed from this formula; if anything, they view U.S. and Western European companies as prime targets for extortion. Notably, **Germany rose to the #2 spot in 2025** as a country targeted, overtaking others ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=The%20US%20remains%20the%20most,is%20exploiting%20vulnerabilities%20in%20German)). Researchers attribute this partly to the **SafePay ransomware group focusing on German organizations** and possibly exploiting software common in German industries ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=resources%20and%20stringent%20cybersecurity%20regulations%2C,incentives%20and%20high%20ransom%20payout)). This shows that when a particular RaaS affiliate has success in a country (or with software used there), it can spike that country’s victim count. Broadly, **Western Europe (UK, France, Italy, etc.) and Canada/Australia** remain heavily targeted as well ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=US%20and%20Germany,and%20high%20ransom%20payout%20likelihoods)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)). The concentration of attacks in **North America and Western Europe** reflects both the financial incentive (strong economies likely to pay) and, ironically, the criminals’ reasoning that companies in these regions face strict regulations and thus may quietly pay to resolve incidents ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=The%20US%20remains%20the%20most,is%20exploiting%20vulnerabilities%20in%20German)).\n\n- **Notable Targeting of Asia and Other Regions:** While Western targets dominate, some emerging groups did skew toward other geographies. For example, as profiled, **DevMan hit many victims in Asia and even Africa** (over 60% of its known victims were in East and Southeast Asia) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=%28over%2060,wide%20distribution)). This possibly aligns with the group’s origin (likely based in Asia) and indicates **regional “home turf” targeting** – they may have better language/cultural access to certain countries, or simply less competition in those locales. Similarly, the **Warlock attacks via SharePoint exploits affected organizations globally, including Asia-Pacific and Middle East** (given Microsoft’s warnings to governments worldwide) ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=attacks%20www,vulnerable%20to%20widespread%20attacks%20targeting)) ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Threat%20Intelligence%20researchers%20have,49704%20vulnerabilities)). We’ve also seen Latin America in victim lists: for instance, Beast ransomware hit some Latin American companies ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)), and other RaaS leak sites list occasional victims in Brazil, Mexico, etc. But generally, **emerging actors still prefer targets in countries with higher revenues** – there were no significant new actors focusing solely on, say, African or South Asian companies (outside of state-sponsored cases). One possible exception is the **Middle East**: by 2025, ransom groups increasingly named Middle Eastern companies (e.g., UAE, Saudi) as victims, perhaps due to growing wealth and digitization in that region. Nova’s leak site listing a Dubai entity in 2026 ([threatlabsnews.xcitium.com](https://threatlabsnews.xcitium.com/blog/from-ralord-to-nova-how-this-raas-gang-is-wreaking-havoc-worldwide/#:~:text=For%20instance%2C%20in%20January%202026%2C,systems%20and%20stolen%20internal%20data)) exemplifies this reach.\n\n- **Top Targeted Industries:** **Manufacturing remains the #1 most targeted sector** by ransomware groups, old and new ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=As%20is%20now%20standard%2C%20manufacturing,can%20dramatically%20shape%20ransomware%20trends)). This is consistently reported, as manufacturing companies often cannot tolerate downtime and thus are prime extortion candidates. In 2025, **professional services (including tech firms)** were also top targets ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=As%20is%20now%20standard%2C%20manufacturing,can%20dramatically%20shape%20ransomware%20trends)). The **construction sector** interestingly climbed into the top three in Q2 2025 ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=As%20is%20now%20standard%2C%20manufacturing,can%20dramatically%20shape%20ransomware%20trends)), after a period of heightened retail sector attacks in Q1 (the retail spike was due to Clop’s mass exploitation of file-transfer software used in retail supply chains) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=As%20is%20now%20standard%2C%20manufacturing,can%20dramatically%20shape%20ransomware%20trends)). By Q4 2025, sectors like **healthcare, education, government, and finance** also remained common targets, largely proportional to their size in the economy. \n\n    - Many *emerging groups do not abide by the “unwritten rules” that some legacy gangs claimed to follow* (such as avoiding hospitals). For example, **BlackSuit/Royal was found to have hit healthcare organizations and public safety agencies** before its shutdown ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/us-government-says-blacksuit-and-royal-ransomware-gangs-hit-hundreds-of-major-firms-before-shutdown#:~:text=hundreds%20of%20major%20firms%20before,to%20a%20press%20release%20from)). Likewise, newbies like NightSpire hit healthcare and education targets without compunction ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=)). The **concept of “forbidden” sectors (hospitals, critical infrastructure)** eroded further in this era – especially after LockBit publicly announced all sectors are fair game ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,limits%20under%20RaaS%20rules)) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=LockBit%205,targets%20unless%20an%20agreement%20is)). So, disproportionately, **essential services and critical manufacturing have remained in the crosshairs**.\n\n    - On the flip side, some smaller groups do specialize or show preferences. **Vice Society**, which emerged earlier (2021) but remained active through 2025, continued disproportionately targeting the education sector (schools and universities) and healthcare. An emerging group in 2025 could similarly pick on under-protected sectors – for instance, a hypothetical new group might choose to focus on municipalities or nonprofits, recognizing they often have weaker security. We saw hints of this in some leak sites that listed many local government victims (the **ALPHV/BlackCat blog in 2025 had numerous county governments in the US, for example**, as it exploited their limited budgets). **Scattered Spider’s planned RaaS** might leverage their history attacking telecom and BPO firms, indicating those sectors could see an uptick if that service launches ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,critical%20infrastructure%20as%20a%20target)) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,Led%20Ransomware%20Service)).\n\n- **Broader Target Spread:** With 80+ active groups, **virtually every industry saw some attacks**. Some sectors not traditionally hit heavily by “big” ransomware experienced attacks from the new fragmented actors. For instance, small ransomware groups have hit **agriculture, real estate, media, and entertainment companies**, which historically were less targeted. ReliaQuest noted that the fragmentation in Q3 2025 led to **sectors and regions not traditionally targeted now seeing attacks** ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,and%20regions%20not%20traditionally%20targeted)). This unpredictability means no organization can assume it’s below ransomware actors’ radar. New groups hungry for any payout will go after **mid-market companies and smaller entities** as well – a departure from the earlier trend of focusing mostly on large enterprises. As an example, **the 8Base group’s victimology (mostly SMBs) demonstrates that many new actors aggressively pursue smaller businesses** ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=The%20Phobos%20%E2%80%93%208Base%20connection)) ([www.helpnetsecurity.com](https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/02/11/8base-ransomware-group-leaders-arrested-leak-site-seized-phobos/#:~:text=match%20at%20L56%20%E2%80%9CTaking%20advantage,data%20but%20also%20threatening%20to)), not just Fortune 500 firms.\n\n- **Geo-Political Targeting:** Some targeting reflects geopolitical motives or convenience. **Russian-speaking gangs continue to avoid hitting Russia or CIS countries**, presumably to stay in good favor locally – this didn’t change with new groups (their leak sites remained void of Russian companies). Meanwhile, **state-affiliated actors like those deploying Warlock chose targets of strategic interest (which included government agencies)**, blurring if the motive was purely financial or partly espionage ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=Microsoft%20Threat%20Intelligence%20researchers%20have,49704%20vulnerabilities)). Also, in the Israel-Hamas war flare (late 2023), *hacktivist ransomware* emerged (e.g. “SiegedSec” and others) that attacked entities in Israel or supportive countries with ransom demands more as political statements. This trend continued with some politically motivated data leaks in 2025, though they were a minority compared to financially driven attacks.\n\nIn summary, **emerging ransomware actors largely follow the money – targeting U.S. and Western European organizations, especially in manufacturing, tech/services, and other critical industries**. The data confirms heavy targeting of those regions (with the U.S. a victim in **67% of cases in Q2 2025 ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=The%20US%20remains%20the%20most,is%20exploiting%20vulnerabilities%20in%20German))**). However, fragmentation has meant **a wider distribution of attacks across sectors and some expansion into new geographies**. No sector can consider itself “safe,” and even countries with fewer past incidents (like in Asia or the Middle East) saw high-profile victims due to the opportunism of these new groups. \n\n**Analyst Note:** For defenders, this means focusing defenses not just on the traditionally targeted verticals, but assuming that *any critical business function* could be a ransomware target. The fact that manufacturing and professional services remain top targets suggests adversaries favor organizations with *both* high downtime costs and capability to pay – a combination found in many industries. The rise of attacks on German firms by SafePay ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=resources%20and%20stringent%20cybersecurity%20regulations%2C,incentives%20and%20high%20ransom%20payout)) or on Japanese firms by groups like NightSpire ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=,education%2C%20manufacturing%2C%20government%2C%20retail%2C%C2%A0logistics%2C%20etc)) are case studies in how one group’s campaign can skew victim stats. Tracking these trends requires continuous threat intelligence, as **the most targeted sectors can shift quarter by quarter based on a single group’s focus ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=As%20is%20now%20standard%2C%20manufacturing,can%20dramatically%20shape%20ransomware%20trends))** (e.g., Clop’s Cleo exploit spree making retail spike, then fading). Overall, emerging actors are casting a wider net, even as they concentrate on lucrative targets.\n\n## Adapting Tactics: Evasion and Extortion Innovations\n\nWith cybersecurity defenses improving, ransomware actors have **sharpened their tactics to bypass protections and increase leverage over victims**. Since 2025, both new and established groups have shown notable adaptations in their techniques:\n\n- **Advanced EDR Evasion and “Defense Neutralization”:** Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) tools and modern anti-malware make traditional ransomware binaries easier to detect. Attackers responded by integrating **EDR-killer capabilities** into their playbooks. Many groups now use the **“Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver” (BYOVD)** technique: they drop an older, signed driver known to have exploitable privileges and use it to disable security software. For example, *The Gentlemen* ransomware was observed using a tool (`Allpatch2.exe`) that exploits **ThrottleStop’s vulnerable driver (ThrottleStop.sys)** to kill processes of antivirus and EDR tools ([ransomnews.online](https://ransomnews.online/hub/ransomnews-thegentlemen.html#:~:text=HUB%20%40%20ransomNews%20,Remote%20access%3A%20AnyDesk%2C%20compromised%20RDP)). Similarly, older gangs like BlackByte and AvosLocker had used the vulnerable **RTCore64 driver** in past attacks – these methods are now widespread among emerging actors. Attackers also leverage scripting (PowerShell, batch files) to turn off Windows Defender, uninstall backup agents, and clear logs as part of the ransomware execution routine. **Living-off-the-land** techniques – e.g., using legit admin binaries like `wmic`, `netsh`, or PowerShell – help criminals blend into normal operations while they prepare the encryption bomb.\n\n- **Shorter Attack Timelines & Avoidance of Detection:** Ransomware dwell time within networks has decreased in many cases – some groups strike within *hours or a couple days* of initial breach, giving defenders a very small window to respond. This “speed run” approach is facilitated by automated tools and scripts. For instance, after infiltrating a network (often via stolen credentials or a vulnerability), attackers may run batch scripts to deploy ransomware to hundreds of machines at once (through domain Group Policy or PsExec) ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=They%20then%20move%20laterally%20with,Warlock%20ransomware%20across%20compromised%20systems)). By simultaneously encrypting many systems, they aim to **overwhelm EDR/quarantine capabilities**. Additionally, almost all modern ransomware is now **packed or obfuscated** to evade static detection. Many are written in less common languages like **Golang, Rust, or Nim**, which produce binaries that generic scanners have a harder time parsing. DireWolf’s Golang malware and DevMan’s switch from C++ to Rust are cases in point, reflecting a wider trend of attackers adopting languages that pose analysis challenges ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/dire-wolf#:~:text=First%20appearing%20May%202025%2C%20this,Curve25519%20and%20ChaCha20%20encryption%20from)) ([www.halcyon.ai](https://www.halcyon.ai/threat-group/devman#:~:text=Operational%20Complexity%20%20,wide%20distribution)). Some groups even employ custom “cryptors” – wrapper software to encrypt and morph the ransomware payload anew for each attack, to avoid signature-based detection.\n\n- **Targeted Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Rather than rely exclusively on phishing or RDP brute force (though those continue), many groups shifted to **exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in internet-facing systems** as a quick path in. The year 2025 saw multiple campaigns built on this: e.g., **Clop ransomware massively exploited zero-days in file transfer software (MOVEit, GoAnywhere, and later Cleo platform) to breach dozens of organizations in one sweep ([www.neteye-blog.com](https://www.neteye-blog.com/2026/01/ransomware-double-extortion-attack-2025-overview/#:~:text=Image))**. Emerging groups learned from this – **Qilin and Akira** (two rising RaaS in 2024–25) were noted to rely on *mass exploitation of vulnerabilities* for initial access ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=,compared%20to%20the%20previous%20quarter)). By using readily available exploits (sometimes straight from proof-of-concept code on GitHub), they can compromise many targets quickly without the uncertainty of phishing. In fact, analysts predict the “next generation” of ransomware leaders will succeed by **“combining automated discovery tools with public proof-of-concept exploits” to speed up compromises ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=and%20precision))**. The Warlock case – exploiting SharePoint 0-days – is an extreme example of using exploits *not just after they’re public, but even as 0-day*, demonstrating the upper end of technical capability in some threat actors ([www.bleepingcomputer.com](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-sharepoint-servers-also-targeted-in-ransomware-attacks/#:~:text=attacks%20www,vulnerable%20to%20widespread%20attacks%20targeting)). Improved patch management by organizations can blunt this, but as long as unpatched systems persist, ransomware crews will weaponize those CVEs for quick wins.\n\n- **Multi-Stage and Covert Operations:** Many emerging groups conduct intrusions that resemble **espionage actors** until the final step. They quietly **exfiltrate large volumes of data** (often over days), use covert backdoors, and establish persistence before detonating ransomware. Sinobi’s “enterprise-aware” style – ensuring they have full domain control and data in hand before encryption ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Sinobi%C2%A0appears%20to%C2%A0operate%C2%A0as%20either%20a%20rebrand,prioritizing%20operational%20control%20before%20monetization)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=reverse%20engineering%20%2F%20attribution%20comparison%29)) – is reflective of this. Some groups deploy **Cobalt Strike beacons or other post-exploitation frameworks** long before deploying ransomware, indicating a period of reconnaissance. This approach counters improved defenses by delaying noisy ransomware actions until the last possible moment, when it’s too late for the victim to respond. It’s also a hedge: if something goes awry, the intruder can still profit by selling or extorting the stolen data without ever launching the encryptor.\n\n- **Extortion Beyond “Double”:** To increase pressure on victims, threat actors have expanded their extortion toolset beyond just encryption (locking files) and data leaks. This **“multi-pronged extortion” or even “triple extortion”** trend includes:\n  - **DDoS Attacks:** Several groups now threaten or carry out **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks** on a victim’s public websites or infrastructure during negotiations ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/ransomware-gangs-are-now-expanding-to-physical-threats-in-the-real-world#:~:text=Denial%20of%20Service%20,choice%20situation%2C%20we)). By taking down the company’s customer-facing services (on top of having their internal data encrypted), attackers apply extra leverage. For example, if a retailer’s website is offline due to DDoS, revenue loss piles on top of the ransomware incident, pressuring the victim to settle quickly. This tactic was observed as early as 2020 (e.g., SunCrypt, RagnarLocker did it), but became more mainstream by 2025. Reports note some ransom groups explicitly offer “DDoS as a service” add-ons to affiliates. TechRadar in late 2025 highlighted that **criminals pair file encryption with DDoS attacks on the front-end, “bringing the entire business to a screeching halt”** in certain cases ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/ransomware-gangs-are-now-expanding-to-physical-threats-in-the-real-world#:~:text=Denial%20of%20Service%20,choice%20situation%2C%20we)).\n  \n  - **Harassing Phone Calls and Emails:** Ransom gangs also started **personally contacting employees and executives** of victim organizations. This can include emails to the board or CEO, or phone calls where hackers directly deliver threats. By informing individuals (and sometimes clients or partners of the victim) about the breach, they create internal pressure on the leadership to resolve the situation. There have been cases of attackers **calling a company’s help desk or CEO** to taunt them that their network is locked – a psychological tactic. The TechRadar piece mentioned that these phone call harassment methods were seen in a couple of cases ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/ransomware-gangs-are-now-expanding-to-physical-threats-in-the-real-world#:~:text=Denial%20of%20Service%20,choice%20situation%2C%20we)).\n  \n  - **Threats of Physical Harm:** In 2025 an alarming statistic emerged from a Semperis security study: **around 46% of U.S. companies that experienced ransomware reported that the attackers threatened physical violence against executives if the ransom wasn’t paid** ([ridgemarkinsurance.com](https://ridgemarkinsurance.com/ransomware-escalates-physical-threats-against-company-leaders/#:~:text=Ransomware%20Escalates%3A%20Physical%20Threats%20Against,were%20physically%20threatened%20if%20their)). These threats are usually delivered via anonymous emails or messages as part of the extortion. For example, a hacker might say *“We know where your CEO lives”* or insinuate they could send someone to their house. While these are almost certainly empty threats (no confirmed cases of cybercriminals acting on them physically), they represent a new **extreme intimidation tactic**. It shows how far ransomware gangs will go to instill fear. As one survey noted in mid-2025, *“in 40%+ of incidents, CEOs or execs were directly threatened with physical harm”* by the attackers ([ridgemarkinsurance.com](https://ridgemarkinsurance.com/ransomware-escalates-physical-threats-against-company-leaders/#:~:text=Ransomware%20Escalates%3A%20Physical%20Threats%20Against,were%20physically%20threatened%20if%20their)). This is effectively **taking extortion into the real world**, adding a terrifying dimension for victims even if it’s just bluster.\n  \n  - **Targeting Customers/Partners:** Another extension has been contacting the victim’s clients or business partners to inform them their data was stolen, attempting to force the victim’s hand via reputational damage. Some gangs set up fake Twitter accounts or dark web pages to leak tidbits of data to media. By involving third parties (customers, regulators, press), they increase the fallout for the victim beyond the immediate IT impact.\n  \n  - **Ransomware + Data Theft *Without* Ransom Demand:** A curious twist observed with a group called **MalasLocker (mid-2023)**, which carried into 2025 discussions: they would encrypt data but instead of a traditional ransom, they demanded the victim **donate to a charity** and show proof of donation to get the decryptor. While not widespread, this Robin Hood-esque stance complicates the landscape (malicious nonetheless, but different motive claims). It didn’t persist widely, but it’s worth noting as an experiment in extortion model – perhaps an attempt to morally justify the crime or confuse law enforcement tracking payments. No major 2025 group copied this approach (most still want direct payment), but it exemplifies the **continual experimentation with extortion methods**.\n\n- **Adaptations to Security Improvements:** As defenders improve backups and incident response, attackers adapt by **seeking out backup systems to delete or encrypt** (targeting shadow copies, NAS backups, cloud backup credentials, etc.). Most ransom notes now specifically mention if backups are found, they’ll be destroyed or already have been. Attackers also monitor response actions in real-time; for instance, some ransomware will detect if it’s running in a sandbox or being debugged and behave benignly to avoid analysis. Others generate unique encryption keys per victim and communicate with command servers so that simply obtaining the binary doesn’t allow decryption for others – a response to earlier incidents where law enforcement shared keys. In general, **ransomware code quality has improved** among top groups, making accidental errors (that allow free decryption) rarer.\n\n- **Focus on Privilege and Identity Abuse:** Recognizing that multifactor authentication and improved identity security were blunting some attacks, ransomware intruders began ***bypassing MFA via social engineering or using MFA fatigue techniques*** (bombarding a user with push notifications). Groups like Scattered Spider, known for such tactics, hint at incorporating this into RaaS offerings ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,Against%20Scattered%20Spider)). Once inside, they seek Domain Admin privileges rapidly (for example, by exploiting Active Directory flaws or using credential dumping tools). **Use of legitimate admin tools** (like the built-in `ntdsutil` to extract AD data, or leveraging systems management software the victim uses) has grown. This lowers their footprint and often evades detection by appearing as normal admin activity.\n\n**Summary of Tactical Trends:** By late 2025, ransomware actors behave more like full-spectrum adversaries: they combine stealth (to evade EDR), speed (to outpace response), and **multi-dimensional extortion** (to leave victims with no good options). Confirmed shifts include **extortion-only attacks gaining popularity ([flashpoint.io](https://flashpoint.io/blog/new-ransomware-as-a-service-raas-groups-to-watch-in-2025/#:~:text=1))**, although pure data-theft attacks often evolve into encryption as well (as the NightSpire case proved) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=NightSpire%C2%A0is%20notable%20for%20its%20evolution,site%20exposure)) ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=%2A%20Observed%20evolution%20from%20exfiltration,in%20later%202025%20activity)). Meanwhile, **double extortion is “business as usual”** and even triple extortion (encrypt + leak + DDoS) is increasingly reported ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/ransomware-gangs-are-now-expanding-to-physical-threats-in-the-real-world#:~:text=Denial%20of%20Service%20,choice%20situation%2C%20we)). Threat actors also tailor their techniques to the environment: if a victim has strong backups, they emphasize data leaks and other pressure; if the victim has sensitive life-or-death operations (like a hospital), they exploit that urgency in negotiations (despite any ethical qualms, as seen when some gangs reneged on healthcare exemptions).\n\nFrom an analyst perspective, these adaptations show an **ongoing cat-and-mouse game between ransomware gangs and defenders**. Every defensive improvement (better EDR, widespread MFA, faster incident response) is met with an offensive adjustment (driver exploits, social engineering of MFA, faster deployment of ransomware, etc.). Notably, the willingness to use psychological and physical intimidation in 2025 is an escalation beyond the technical realm, indicating that top-tier cybercriminals are **resorting to mafia-like tactics** to secure payment ([ridgemarkinsurance.com](https://ridgemarkinsurance.com/ransomware-escalates-physical-threats-against-company-leaders/#:~:text=Ransomware%20Escalates%3A%20Physical%20Threats%20Against,were%20physically%20threatened%20if%20their)) ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/ransomware-gangs-are-now-expanding-to-physical-threats-in-the-real-world#:~:text=Denial%20of%20Service%20,choice%20situation%2C%20we)). This is a worrying trend that could attract even greater law enforcement attention, but also could scare victims into compliance.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The late-2025 to early-2026 ransomware landscape is one of **highly active, dynamic threat actors who are often new in name but not necessarily new in experience**. Emerging groups have quickly stepped into the void left by disrupted gangs, bringing with them **sophisticated tactics, cross-platform capabilities, and aggressive extortion techniques**. The **RaaS economy’s evolution** – toward fragmentation, affiliate-hopping, and innovation in criminal business models – has made the ecosystem more resilient to crackdowns. Law enforcement operations, while increasing in frequency and global coordination, have so far only modestly hindered the overall volume of attacks ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/takedowns-and-arrests-didnt-slow-down-ransomware-in-2025#:~:text=2026,victims%20rose%20from%20approximately%205%2C400)). The ransomware actors’ behavior (rebranding, shifting infrastructure, and upping the ante on victims) shows a threat that is adaptive and not easily deterred.\n\nGoing into 2026, organizations face a **plurality of ransomware threats** rather than a few big names. Many of these groups share similar techniques (thanks to common tutelage or leaked code) – meaning even smaller actors can cause **“enterprise-grade” damage ([cyble.com](https://cyble.com/knowledge-hub/10-new-ransomware-groups-of-2025-threat-trend-2026/#:~:text=Even%20as%20global%20law%20enforcement,grade%20efficiency))**. Key sectors like manufacturing, tech, and critical services remain hot targets, especially in the U.S. and Europe ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=The%20US%20remains%20the%20most,is%20exploiting%20vulnerabilities%20in%20German)) ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/ransomware-cyber-extortion-threat-intel-q2-2025/#:~:text=As%20is%20now%20standard%2C%20manufacturing,can%20dramatically%20shape%20ransomware%20trends)), but no sector or region is truly safe given the opportunism arising from the ransomware fragmentation ([reliaquest.com](https://reliaquest.com/blog/threat-spotlight-ransomware-and-cyber-extortion-in-q3-2025/#:~:text=,and%20regions%20not%20traditionally%20targeted)). \n\nOn the defensive side, knowing the **profiles and tactics of these emerging groups** is crucial for risk assessment. For instance, recognizing that a group like Gentlemen might already have domain-wide persistence means responders must check Group Policy and admin tool logs; understanding that a gang like SafePay favors certain regions can inform threat hunting in those locales. Effective defense in this era requires not just patching and backing up, but also **anticipating the extortion playbook** – from DDoS to doxxing – that might be used against an organization.\n\nIn summary, the modern ransomware threat actor landscape is characterized by **rapid adaptation, a proliferation of new actors (often built on old bones), and an expansion of criminal tactics beyond the purely technical**. While confirmed intelligence gives us profiles of groups like DevMan, Nova, Sinobi, and The Gentlemen – each with unique traits – they collectively indicate where ransomware is heading: **more diffuse, arguably more dangerous, and deeply embedded in an ongoing arms race with defenders**. Continued tracking of these actors and collaboration across law enforcement and industry will be needed to turn the tide, as thus far the ecosystem has proven it can **survive and evolve in spite of considerable pressure** ([www.cybernewscentre.com](https://www.cybernewscentre.com/5th-august-2025-cyber-update-global-blacksuit-ransomware-takedown/#:~:text=The%20operation%27s%20success%20in%20disrupting,criminal%20reorganization%20under%20new%20banners)). \n\n",
