# Research Task: Current State of Quantum Computing (2025–2026)

## Scope
- Include: Major hardware milestones, error correction breakthroughs, key industry players, recent funding trends, and near-term commercial applications
- Exclude: Deep quantum physics theory, historical timeline before 2024, quantum cryptography policy debates

## Key Questions
1. What are the most significant quantum computing hardware milestones achieved in 2025–2026?
2. Which companies/labs are leading and what are their current qubit counts and error rates?
3. What progress has been made on quantum error correction?
4. What are the nearest-term practical/commercial applications showing real results?

## Depth & Focus
Moderate depth — prioritize breadth of coverage across questions over exhaustive detail on any single one. Focus on verifiable claims with sources.

## Output Expectations
- Structured report with clear sections per key question
- Cite specific sources with URLs where possible
- 1,500–3,000 words per provider
