# Current State of Quantum Computing (2025–2026)

## Introduction  
Quantum computing has advanced rapidly in the mid-2020s, with significant strides in hardware capability, error correction, and early applications. In 2025 and early 2026, researchers and companies achieved record qubit counts, improved stability, and even demonstrated the first **practical quantum advantages** on specific problems. Major industry players – from tech giants to startups – are racing to build more powerful quantum processors, backed by substantial funding and national initiatives. This report examines the latest hardware milestones, leading platforms (with their qubit counts and error rates), breakthroughs in quantum error correction, and the nearest-term commercial applications showing tangible results.

## 1. Major Hardware Milestones (2025–2026)  
**Scaling Up Qubits:** Leading quantum hardware teams vastly expanded qubit counts and processor designs. IBM reached the **1,000+ qubit** scale in late 2023 with its “Condor” prototype chip, and in 2025 it unveiled new processors on its roadmap to full-scale quantum computing ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=Scientists%20at%20IBM%20have%20created,all%20errors%20in%20real%20time)). Notably, IBM’s **Nighthawk** chip (2025) contains 120 superconducting qubits in a lattice with 218 improved couplers, enabling circuits with ~5,000 two-qubit gates – 30% more complex than possible on its prior generation ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=The%20first%20processor%2C%20called%20IBM,all%20errors%20in%20real%20time)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=Nighthawk%20enables%20each%20of%20the,hopes%20that%20future%20versions%20of)). IBM also introduced **“Loon,”** a 112-qubit processor that incorporates all hardware elements required for real-time error correction and fault tolerance ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=company%27s%20previous%20QPU%20,all%20errors%20in%20real%20time)). While IBM did build a 1,000-qubit device, it found that a smaller 127-qubit chip (“Eagle”) was actually more reliable – achieving about **5× lower error rates** than the larger chip ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=why%20quantum%20processors%20are%20getting,way%20connections)). This underscored a key 2025 theme: progress is not just about adding qubits, but improving their quality and connectivity.

Google made headlines with its new **“Willow”** quantum processor, a 105-qubit superconducting chip unveiled in late 2024. Willow demonstrated unprecedented performance by running a complex simulation (modeling an NMR physics experiment) **13,000× faster** than a classical supercomputer ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/googles-quantum-echo-algorithm-shows-worlds-first-practical-application-of-quantum-computing-willow-105-qubit-chip-runs-algorithm-13-000x-faster-than-a-supercomputer#:~:text=,best%20classic%20algorithm%20on%20the)). This experiment – using 101 of Willow’s qubits – was *verifiable* and marked the first time a quantum computer solved a practical scientific problem dramatically faster than any classical method ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/googles-quantum-echo-algorithm-shows-worlds-first-practical-application-of-quantum-computing-willow-105-qubit-chip-runs-algorithm-13-000x-faster-than-a-supercomputer#:~:text=,best%20classic%20algorithm%20on%20the)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/googles-quantum-echo-algorithm-shows-worlds-first-practical-application-of-quantum-computing-willow-105-qubit-chip-runs-algorithm-13-000x-faster-than-a-supercomputer#:~:text=The%20algorithm%20in%20question%20is,are%20reproducible%20and%20were%20checked)). The Willow chip also showcased improved scaling: unlike earlier devices that grew noisier with size, Willow’s larger qubit array actually achieved **lower error rates per operation as qubit count increased**, thanks to Google’s advances in error suppression ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=Correcci%C3%B3n%20de%20errores%20%27por%20debajo,desde%20hace%2030%20a%C3%B1os%2C%20agrega)) ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=,como%20%27por%20debajo%20del%20umbral)). This was hailed as a historic “below threshold” achievement in which adding qubits *reduced* net errors – a crucial milestone toward building big, useful quantum machines ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=Correcci%C3%B3n%20de%20errores%20%27por%20debajo,desde%20hace%2030%20a%C3%B1os%2C%20agrega)) ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=,cambiar%20las%20propiedades%20y%20resultados)).

Trapped-ion technology also leaped forward. In November 2025, Quantinuum (the company formed by Honeywell’s quantum unit and Cambridge Quantum) announced **“Helios,”** a record-breaking trapped-ion system with 98 physical qubits made of barium ions ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=At%20the%20heart%20of%20the,in%20partnership%20with%20the%20company)). Arranged in a novel junction trap architecture, these qubits delivered the highest performance to date on several benchmarks ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=At%20the%20heart%20of%20the,in%20partnership%20with%20the%20company)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=The%20scientists%20claim%20this%20is,shy%20about%20that%20at%20all)). In one test, Helios was used to simulate a superconducting metal, yielding a new discovery about the material’s atomic behavior ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=The%20scientists%20claim%20this%20is,shy%20about%20that%20at%20all)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=simulate%20a%20superconducting%20metal%20and,of%20computational%20design%20and%20theory)) – an indication that quantum simulation is becoming powerful enough to generate scientific insights. Notably, the Helios team *meshed* the 98 physical qubits into 48 fully error-corrected **logical qubits**, achieving “better than break-even” error correction (meaning the logical qubits were more reliable than the uncorrected physical ones) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=Scientists%20meshed%20the%2098%20physical,to%20create%20one%20logical%20qubit)). This was achieved with an effective 2:1 physical-to-logical qubit ratio, far better than the ~10:1 overhead many expected ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=Scientists%20meshed%20the%2098%20physical,to%20create%20one%20logical%20qubit)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=doing%20so%2C%20the%20team%20achieved,got%20that%20down%20to%202%3A1)). Such results suggest trapped-ion platforms can reach useful scales sooner by combining high-fidelity qubits with efficient error correction.

Other hardware modalities hit milestones as well. Researchers at Harvard and MIT built a **neutral-atom quantum computer** that ran continuously for over two hours in 2025 – far longer than the millisecond-scale operation of most prior systems ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/harvard-researchers-hail-quantum-computing-breakthrough-with-machine-that-can-run-for-two-hours-atomic-loss-quashed-by-experimental-design-systems-that-can-run-forever-just-3-years-away#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20physicists%20from,run%20for%20much%20longer%2C%20maybe)). They used **3,000 ultracold atoms** in an optical lattice with a conveyor-belt mechanism to replace atoms as they were lost, effectively quashing atomic loss and allowing potentially indefinite operation ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/harvard-researchers-hail-quantum-computing-breakthrough-with-machine-that-can-run-for-two-hours-atomic-loss-quashed-by-experimental-design-systems-that-can-run-forever-just-3-years-away#:~:text=The%20research%20team%20addressed%20this,being%20stored%20in%20the%20system)). This “quantum assembly line” approach dramatically improved system runtime and points toward hardware that could run **hours or forever** by 2028 ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/harvard-researchers-hail-quantum-computing-breakthrough-with-machine-that-can-run-for-two-hours-atomic-loss-quashed-by-experimental-design-systems-that-can-run-forever-just-3-years-away#:~:text=run%20for%20two%20hours%20%E2%80%94,2%2015%3A59%3A21%202025%20UTC)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/harvard-researchers-hail-quantum-computing-breakthrough-with-machine-that-can-run-for-two-hours-atomic-loss-quashed-by-experimental-design-systems-that-can-run-forever-just-3-years-away#:~:text=The%20research%20team%20addressed%20this,being%20stored%20in%20the%20system)). In another demonstration of scale, Caltech scientists synchronized **6,100 neutral-atom qubits** in a single system at room temperature – the largest quantum array ever created to date ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/quantum-record-smashed-as-scientists-build-mammoth-6-000-qubit-system-and-it-works-at-room-temperature#:~:text=2025,used%20neutral%20atoms%20held%20in)). While such neutral-atom systems are currently used for analog simulations, their size and room-temperature operation highlight impressive engineering progress.

Solid-state qubits made gains in manufacturability. In September 2025, U.K. startup Quantum Motion unveiled the **world’s first quantum computer built using regular silicon chips**, fabricated in a standard CMOS process ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-unveil-worlds-first-quantum-computer-built-with-regular-silicon-chips#:~:text=A%20U,and%20less%20expensive%20manufacturing%20processes)). The system uses electron-spin qubits on a 300 mm silicon wafer and packs the quantum processor plus control electronics into three 19-inch racks – a very compact footprint ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-unveil-worlds-first-quantum-computer-built-with-regular-silicon-chips#:~:text=The%20machine%20is%20built%20using,and%20produce%20the%20extremely%20low)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-unveil-worlds-first-quantum-computer-built-with-regular-silicon-chips#:~:text=physical%20quantum%20hardware%20,chip%20%28SoC%29%20is)). This CMOS-based approach promises easier scaling using existing chip industry infrastructure. Quantum Motion’s design is modular (using tiled “chiplet” units) and could ultimately integrate **millions of spin qubits** on a palm-sized chip ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-unveil-worlds-first-quantum-computer-built-with-regular-silicon-chips#:~:text=match%20at%20L33%20computation%20happens%2C,said%20James%20Palles)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-unveil-worlds-first-quantum-computer-built-with-regular-silicon-chips#:~:text=entanglement%20,slightest%20interaction%20with%20the%20environment)). Similarly, researchers at Princeton developed a new fabrication method for superconducting qubits using **tantalum on silicon**, achieving qubit coherence times up to 1.68 ms – about **15× longer** than the qubits in Google’s and IBM’s current processors ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/record-breaking-feat-means-information-lasts-15-times-longer-in-new-kind-of-quantum-processor-than-those-used-by-google-and-ibm#:~:text=Researchers%20used%20tantalum%20grown%20on,Andrew%20Houck%2C%20Princeton%27s%20dean%20of)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/record-breaking-feat-means-information-lasts-15-times-longer-in-new-kind-of-quantum-processor-than-those-used-by-google-and-ibm#:~:text=coherent%20for%20up%20to%201,scientists%20said%20in%20a%20statement)). Longer coherence directly boosts how many operations qubits can perform, making this “tantalum qubit” advance “the next big jump forward” in hardware stability ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/record-breaking-feat-means-information-lasts-15-times-longer-in-new-kind-of-quantum-processor-than-those-used-by-google-and-ibm#:~:text=,the%20next%20big%20jump%20forward)).

Even **quantum annealers**, which use thousands of specialized qubits for optimization problems, saw improvement. D-Wave Systems released its new **Advantage2** annealing computer in 2025 with **∼4,400 superconducting qubits**, offering higher connectivity and lower noise than its previous 5,000-qubit model ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2025-05-20/la-empresa-de-computacion-cuantica-d-wave-quantum-se-dispara-en-bolsa-tras-poner-a-la-venta-su-nuevo-superordenador.html#:~:text=otras%20palabras%2C%20los%20sistemas%20basados,400)). Advantage2 became available via cloud or on-premises, and D-Wave reported it can tackle larger optimization problems than ever before. Meanwhile, photonic quantum computers began moving from theory to prototype: Silicon Valley startup PsiQuantum raised $1 billion in 2025 to build a **million-qubit photonic quantum computer** using light-based qubits and semiconductor manufacturing techniques ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/psiquantum-plans-to-build-worlds-first-large-scale-fault-tolerant-million-qubit-quantum-computers-for-solving-some-of-the-worlds-most-complex-scientific-problems#:~:text=PsiQuantum%20has%20announced%20that%20it,its%20approach%20on%20photonic%20qubits)). And in China, a firm called CHIPX unveiled a photonic chip with **over 1,000 optical components** monolithically integrated on a 6-inch wafer – reportedly making it *“1,000 times faster”* than NVIDIA GPUs for certain AI tasks ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/new-chinese-optical-quantum-chip-allegedly-1-000x-faster-than-nvidia-gpus-for-processing-ai-workloads-but-yields-are-low#:~:text=%22industrial,a%20monolithic%20design%2C%20making%20them)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/new-chinese-optical-quantum-chip-allegedly-1-000x-faster-than-nvidia-gpus-for-processing-ai-workloads-but-yields-are-low#:~:text=faster,with%20these%20quantum%20chips%20to)). While such claims are optimistic, the chip’s design allows multiple photonic processors to be linked like GPU clusters, theoretically scaling to a million-qubit photonic network ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/new-chinese-optical-quantum-chip-allegedly-1-000x-faster-than-nvidia-gpus-for-processing-ai-workloads-but-yields-are-low#:~:text=All%20of%20these%20factors%20have,efficiently%20and%20faster%20than%20electricity)) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/new-chinese-optical-quantum-chip-allegedly-1-000x-faster-than-nvidia-gpus-for-processing-ai-workloads-but-yields-are-low#:~:text=computers,qubits%20of%20quantum%20processing%20power)). Though many of these developments remain in early stages, collectively they indicate that **quantum hardware is rapidly scaling up** (in qubit count, coherence, and integration), setting new records and overcoming key engineering limits as of 2025–2026.

## 2. Leading Players: Qubit Counts & Error Rates  
Several companies and labs lead the quantum computing race, each with different technologies. **IBM** and **Google** continue to spearhead superconducting qubit development. IBM’s publicly accessible quantum processors now range from 127 qubits (Eagle) to 433 qubits (Osprey, 2022 generation), and its latest experimental chips include the 120-qubit Nighthawk (2025). IBM even built a 1,121-qubit chip (Project Condor) as a technology test, though its focus has shifted toward improving error rates and connectivity rather than just raw qubit numbers ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=In%20December%202023%2C%20for%20example%2C,layers%20of%20routing%20on%20the)). IBM’s Eagle processor achieved significantly better fidelity – its error rates were about *five times lower* than those of the first 1,000-qubit Condor, making Eagle more useful despite having fewer qubits ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=In%20December%202023%2C%20for%20example%2C,layers%20of%20routing%20on%20the)). IBM reports two-qubit gate errors on its best chips on the order of 1% or less, and single-qubit errors well below that, with steady improvement each hardware generation. The 120-qubit Nighthawk uses a new Coupler architecture to further improve gate fidelity and support more entangling operations ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=Nighthawk%20enables%20each%20of%20the,hopes%20that%20future%20versions%20of)). In IBM’s words, its R&D is making processors “more sophisticated and not simply larger” to reach **quantum advantage** (where a quantum computer outperforms classical systems on a practical task) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=Scientists%20at%20IBM%20have%20created,all%20errors%20in%20real%20time)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/ibm-unveils-two-new-quantum-processors-including-one-that-offers-a-blueprint-for-fault-tolerant-quantum-computing-by-2029#:~:text=Reaching%20quantum%20advantage%20and%20beyond)). By late 2025, IBM was confident enough to predict it will achieve quantum advantage in the next **12 months** – within 2026 – given these hardware gains ([www.itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/technology/big-data/ibm-is-targeting-quantum-advantage-in-12-months-and-says-useful-quantum-computing-is-just-a-few-years-away#:~:text=IBM%20predicts%20it%20will%20reach,quantum%20computing%20for%20decades%2C%20but)).

Google’s **Quantum AI** division similarly emphasizes balanced progress in qubit count and quality. Google’s latest device, the 105-qubit **Willow** processor, was used to demonstrate a logical qubit with an error rate of only ~**0.1% per operation** after error correction – a milestone indicating Google’s physical qubits have crossed the error threshold needed for scaling ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=A%C3%BAn%20muy%20preliminar%20Para%20Carlos,necesitar%C3%ADan%20millones%20de%20c%C3%BAbits%20f%C3%ADsicos)). (For comparison, a typical physical two-qubit gate error on Google’s earlier 53-qubit Sycamore processor was a few percent; Willow’s effective logical error of 0.1% shows dramatic improvement in aggregate system reliability.) Google has not officially announced a higher qubit count beyond Willow’s ~100 qubits as of 2025, instead focusing on reducing errors and implementing **surface code** error correction on its current qubits. In fact, Google demonstrated that using more qubits in its error-correcting code *suppressed* errors exponentially, an achievement never seen before ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=Correcci%C3%B3n%20de%20errores%20%27por%20debajo,desde%20hace%2030%20a%C3%B1os%2C%20agrega)). This “below-threshold” behavior gives Google a clear path to scale up – and company leaders suggest that truly useful, large-scale quantum computers could be just “a few years” away if these trends continue ([www.itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/technology/sundar-pichai-thinks-commercially-viable-quantum-computing-is-just-a-few-years-away#:~:text=2025,imminent%20the%20breakthrough%20will%20be)). In the meantime, Google’s 100-qubit-class machines continue to lead on quantum circuit performance benchmarks (e.g. random circuit sampling tests) with the **best-in-class results** as of late 2024 ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=Ampliamente%20utilizado%20en%20este%20campo%2C,escalable%20construido%20hasta%20la%20fecha)).

In the **trapped-ion camp**, two companies stand out: **Quantinuum** and **IonQ**. Quantinuum’s latest generation system (H2/H3, exemplified by the Helios prototype) uses ~100 ytterbium or barium ion qubits with world-leading gate fidelities. In the Helios research experiment, 98 physical ions were configured into 48 logical qubits, achieving error-corrected operations that actually outperformed physical qubit operations (“better than break-even”) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=Scientists%20meshed%20the%2098%20physical,to%20create%20one%20logical%20qubit)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=doing%20so%2C%20the%20team%20achieved,got%20that%20down%20to%202%3A1)). This implies effective logical error rates significantly below 1% in that system. Quantinuum scientists reported that whereas many experts assumed ~10 physical qubits might be needed per logical qubit, they have reduced that overhead to about 2:1 in certain conditions ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=doing%20so%2C%20the%20team%20achieved,got%20that%20down%20to%202%3A1)). Such high fidelity is enabled by ion traps’ inherently long coherence and all-to-all connectivity, combined with improved error suppression techniques. Quantinuum’s machines (H1 series, etc.) had earlier achieved two-qubit gate fidelities around 99.7%, and the company is pushing toward 99.9% and beyond in newer designs. Its Director of Theory confidently stated in 2025, *“Currently, this is easily the most powerful quantum computer on Earth,”* referring to the Helios system’s performance ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=behavior%20of%20the%20material.%20,shy%20about%20that%20at%20all)).

IonQ, another leading ion-trap company, has taken a slightly different approach to reporting performance. Rather than quoting raw qubit counts, IonQ often uses a metric called **“#AQ” (algorithmic qubits)** which reflects the size of problem its machine can reliably run. In January 2024, IonQ announced its **Forte** system reached #AQ 35, meaning it can execute certain 35-qubit algorithms successfully ([www.ionq.com](https://www.ionq.com/blog/how-we-achieved-our-2024-performance-target-of-aq-35#:~:text=Today%2C%20we%20announced%20that%20IonQ,months%20early%20in%20June%202023)) ([www.ionq.com](https://www.ionq.com/blog/how-we-achieved-our-2024-performance-target-of-aq-35#:~:text=software%20upgrades.%20First%20with%20,all%20qubit%20connectivity)). This was ahead of schedule and up from #AQ 29 achieved in 2023 ([www.ionq.com](https://www.ionq.com/blog/how-we-achieved-our-2024-performance-target-of-aq-35#:~:text=available%20quantum%20computer%2C%20successfully%20passed,months%20early%20in%20June%202023)). IonQ’s roadmap aims for #AQ 64 by around 2025–26, which they predict will be a threshold where quantum circuits of commercial value can run reliably ([www.ionq.com](https://www.ionq.com/blog/how-we-achieved-our-2024-performance-target-of-aq-35#:~:text=While%20we%20continue%20to%20work,the%20next%20target%20on%20our)). In physical terms, IonQ’s current devices use chains of ~30–40 trapped ytterbium ions. Thanks to recent breakthroughs, IonQ’s two-qubit gate fidelities are **>99.99%** (error <0.01%) – a world record announced in late 2025 ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/#:~:text=21%20Oct%202025%20%E2%80%93%20IonQ,arXiv%20preprint%20for%20the%20details)). This feat was achieved using a novel “smooth” microwave-driven gate (from its acquired partner, Oxford Ionics) that avoids certain error sources like motional heating ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/#:~:text=21%20Oct%202025%20%E2%80%93%20IonQ,arXiv%20preprint%20for%20the%20details)). Such ultra-high fidelity means IonQ can afford to increase qubit count (it projects a 256-qubit system in 2026) without losing too much accuracy ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/#:~:text=21%20Oct%202025%20%E2%80%93%20IonQ,arXiv%20preprint%20for%20the%20details)) ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/#:~:text=without%20ground%E2%80%91state%20cooling,the%20%2019%20official%20press)). Indeed, one research team demonstrated an even more extreme fidelity: an error rate of only **0.000015%** (one error per 6.7 million operations) on a trapped-ion quantum logic experiment ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=In%20research%20published%20June%2012,a%20quantum%20computer%27s%20outputs%20useless)). Although that was a specialized lab setup, it shows the physical *ceiling* for ion-trap performance is extraordinarily high when optimized – a very promising sign for IonQ and others aiming to scale ion-based quantum computers.

Among **other players**, **Rigetti Computing** (USA) continues to develop superconducting multi-chip modules (recently 84 qubits), though it has faced challenges improving two-qubit gate fidelity (historically in the 90–95% range). **Infleqtion/ColdQuanta and Pasqal** (working with neutral Rydberg atoms) have built 100–300 qubit analog quantum simulators and are now pursuing gate-based modes with dozens of qubits. **Xanadu** (Canada) leads in photonic Gaussian boson sampling and is researching fault-tolerant photonic qubits, though it hasn’t announced a qubit count comparable to superconducting or ion systems. **D-Wave Systems**, as mentioned, offers a different paradigm with its 4,000+ qubit quantum annealers for optimization; those qubits are not gate-programmable, but D-Wave also has a small (few-qubit) gate-model prototype in the works. **China’s** quantum efforts, while somewhat opaque, have produced competitive devices: for example, in 2021 USTC in Hefei built a 66-qubit superconducting processor (Zuchongzhi) that achieved a quantum supremacy sampling result. There are reports that Chinese researchers continue to enhance superconducting qubit counts and photonic systems, but specific 2025–2026 milestones are less publicly documented. Overall, as of early 2026 the clear leaders in qubit capacity and fidelity are IBM, Google, Quantinuum, and IonQ – each now operating 50–100+ qubit processors with **errors per gate on the order of 0.1–1% or better** after internal corrections ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=A%C3%BAn%20muy%20preliminar%20Para%20Carlos,necesitar%C3%ADan%20millones%20de%20c%C3%BAbits%20f%C3%ADsicos)) ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/#:~:text=21%20Oct%202025%20%E2%80%93%20IonQ,arXiv%20preprint%20for%20the%20details)). These error rates, while not yet at the 10^-9 levels needed for *unrestricted* quantum computing, are improving steadily, giving credence to claims that useful quantum advantage is nearing.

## 3. Progress in Quantum Error Correction  
Achieving practical **quantum error correction (QEC)** has been a long-standing hurdle, but recent breakthroughs suggest the field is finally entering the error-corrected era. In theory, QEC allows a “logical” qubit to be encoded across many physical qubits such that errors can be detected and fixed on the fly, stabilizing quantum computations. Throughout 2025, multiple teams reported milestone results demonstrating QEC working in practice.

Google’s Quantum AI group achieved perhaps the most celebrated result: they demonstrated that when encoding a logical qubit across **# physical qubits (using a surface code), each additional qubit **suppressed the error rate exponentially** ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=Correcci%C3%B3n%20de%20errores%20%27por%20debajo,desde%20hace%2030%20a%C3%B1os%2C%20agrega)) ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=,como%20%27por%20debajo%20del%20umbral)). This is exactly the behavior QEC theory predicts once the physical error rate falls below a certain threshold. In Google’s experiments on the **Willow** processor, a logical qubit composed of 49 physical qubits showed lower error probability than one composed of 17 qubits, which in turn was better than a single physical qubit – confirming the error suppression trend ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=Correcci%C3%B3n%20de%20errores%20%27por%20debajo,desde%20hace%2030%20a%C3%B1os%2C%20agrega)). By extrapolating with 101 qubits, Google hit the regime of “below threshold” error correction ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=m%C3%A1s%20c%C3%BAbits%2C%20suprime%20los%20errores,desde%20hace%2030%20a%C3%B1os%2C%20agrega)). In fact, with the 101-qubit logical encoding, they achieved an error rate around **0.1% per operation** on the logical qubit ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=A%C3%BAn%20muy%20preliminar%20Para%20Carlos,necesitar%C3%ADan%20millones%20de%20c%C3%BAbits%20f%C3%ADsicos)). This is a landmark: it marked the first time a logical qubit beat the physical qubits so decisively, proving that full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing is feasible in principle. Hartmut Neven, Google’s Quantum AI director, called it a “historic achievement” – the first system to operate *below the error correction threshold*, and “the most compelling scalable logical qubit prototype to date” ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=,como%20%27por%20debajo%20del%20umbral)) ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=el%20sistema%2C%20lo%20que%20puede,supremac%C3%ADa%20cu%C3%A1ntica)). While it’s still a long road from a single protected qubit to a universal fault-tolerant machine (thousands of logical qubits would require millions of physical qubits at current efficiency ([www.huffingtonpost.es](https://www.huffingtonpost.es/tecnologia/willow-nuevo-chip-cuantico-google-potencia-calculo-extraordinaria.html#:~:text=de%20Madrid%2C%20Google%20demuestra%20que,uno%20cl%C3%A1sico%20y%20con%20aplicaciones))), this result resolves a 30-year question by showing QEC actually works as expected in a real quantum processor.

Not long after, **Quantinuum** announced its own QEC milestone with the **Helios** trapped-ion system. By forming 48 logical qubits out of 98 physical qubits (using efficient parity-check groupings), the team achieved a scenario where the logical qubits had longer lifetimes and higher calculation success rates than the bare physical qubits ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=Scientists%20meshed%20the%2098%20physical,to%20create%20one%20logical%20qubit)). David Hayes, Quantinuum’s director of theory, stated they attained “better than break-even” error correction – essentially meaning their QEC code provided a net benefit, not just overhead ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=Scientists%20meshed%20the%2098%20physical,to%20create%20one%20logical%20qubit)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=doing%20so%2C%20the%20team%20achieved,got%20that%20down%20to%202%3A1)). This was striking because many experts thought it would require coding 10 or more ions per logical qubit to see an improvement; Quantinuum showed it could be done with just **2 physical qubits per logical qubit** in their special ion-trap architecture ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=doing%20so%2C%20the%20team%20achieved,got%20that%20down%20to%202%3A1)). (They used pairs of ions as logical qubits with a couple of spare ions for error detection.) While this simplified QEC code can’t correct every possible error, it did extend coherence and reduce net error rates. Experiments with larger logical groupings (e.g. 50 or 96 logical qubits) were less efficient, but the success with 48 logical qubits suggests that **small-scale error-corrected quantum memory is now a reality** ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=So%20far%2C%20scientists%20have%20assumed,scientists%20scale%20them%20up%20to)). These advances will make it easier to scale up to much larger machines, since the principles of error correction have been proven on current hardware.

Another standout development came from **QuEra**, a startup using neutral-atom qubits. In mid-2025, QuEra researchers demonstrated **“magic state distillation” on logical qubits** – something scientists had been trying to do for 20 years ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=The%20process%2C%20called%20,to%20process%20information%20in%20parallel)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=computing%3F%20%20Now%2C%20however%2C%20scientists,14%20in%20the%20journal%20Nature)). Magic states are special quantum states needed to perform non-Clifford gates (the types of operations that give quantum computers their true power). Distilling high-quality magic states is essential for universal fault-tolerant computing, but before 2025 it had never been shown using *logical* qubits (only with noisy physical qubits, which isn’t scalable) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=This%20process%20has%20so%20far,it%20mean%20for%20quantum%20computing)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=computing%3F%20%20Now%2C%20however%2C%20scientists,14%20in%20the%20journal%20Nature)). QuEra’s team used their **Gemini** neutral-atom quantum computer to encode logical qubits of distance 3 and 5 (meaning they could correct 1 or 2 errors, respectively) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20using%20the,So)). They then successfully distilled five “imperfect” magic states into one high-fidelity magic state using those logical qubits ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=refined,3%20means%20that%20you)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=In%20the%20study%2C%20using%20the,So)). The output state’s fidelity exceeded that of any input state, proving the distillation worked as intended ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=computers%20after%20%27decade%20in%20the,The%20challenge)). As the authors noted, *“quantum computers cannot fulfill their promise without magic state distillation… It’s a required milestone”* ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=It%20has%20long%20been%20considered,utilized%20by%20the%20most%20complex)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=computing%3F%20%20Now%2C%20however%2C%20scientists,14%20in%20the%20journal%20Nature)). Achieving this on logical qubits means a fully error-corrected quantum computer will be able to run the most complex algorithms (like Shor’s factoring or advanced chemistry simulations) in the future. This result, published in **Nature** in July 2025, was hailed as moving the field significantly closer to fault-tolerant machines ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-make-magic-state-breakthrough-after-20-years-without-it-quantum-computers-can-never-be-truly-useful#:~:text=computers%20after%20%27decade%20in%20the,The%20challenge)).

QuEra also introduced a concept called **Algorithmic Fault Tolerance (AFT)** to reduce the overhead of error correction. Instead of checking qubits on a rigid schedule, AFT restructures quantum **algorithms** themselves so they can detect and correct errors on the fly during computation ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-moves-the-timeline-forward-significantly-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-slash-pesky-errors-by-up-to-100-times#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20discovered%20a%20way,24%20in%20the%20journal)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-moves-the-timeline-forward-significantly-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-slash-pesky-errors-by-up-to-100-times#:~:text=The%20technique%2C%20called%20algorithmic%20fault,Live%20Science%2C%20Yuval%20Boger%2C%20chief)). Simulations showed that AFT could cut the time and resources spent on QEC by up to **100×** while still maintaining accuracy ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-moves-the-timeline-forward-significantly-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-slash-pesky-errors-by-up-to-100-times#:~:text=Researchers%20have%20discovered%20a%20way,24%20in%20the%20journal)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-moves-the-timeline-forward-significantly-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-slash-pesky-errors-by-up-to-100-times#:~:text=to%20run%20checks%20at%20fixed,with%20hardware%20tests%20likely)). Essentially, the algorithm self-corrects as it runs, avoiding many redundant checks. QuEra scientists reported this major theoretical milestone in late 2025 (also in *Nature*), and they plan hardware tests of AFT within a year or two ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-moves-the-timeline-forward-significantly-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-slash-pesky-errors-by-up-to-100-times#:~:text=In%20an%20email%20to%20Live,once%20assumed%20is%20not%20inevitable)). If successful, this could significantly speed up quantum computations – addressing the “enormous overhead” challenge and “moving the timeline forward significantly” for practical quantum computers ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-moves-the-timeline-forward-significantly-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-slash-pesky-errors-by-up-to-100-times#:~:text=roadmap%20to%20practical%2C%20large,once%20assumed%20is%20not%20inevitable)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-moves-the-timeline-forward-significantly-quantum-computing-breakthrough-could-slash-pesky-errors-by-up-to-100-times#:~:text=%22Practical%20fault,once%20assumed%20is%20not%20inevitable)).

In addition to these coding breakthroughs, improved physical qubit quality makes QEC easier. As mentioned, IonQ’s new “smooth” gate technique achieved **99.99% fidelity** on two-qubit operations – reducing error to 1 in 10,000, even without special cooling of the ions ([postquantum.com](https://postquantum.com/quantum-research/ionq-record-2025/#:~:text=21%20Oct%202025%20%E2%80%93%20IonQ,arXiv%20preprint%20for%20the%20details)). Such fidelity means fewer error-correction cycles are required to maintain coherence. Likewise, a team in 2025 demonstrated an error rate of just **1 in 6.7 million operations** on a trapped-ion system by using a clever microwave trapping method at room temperature ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=In%20research%20published%20June%2012,a%20quantum%20computer%27s%20outputs%20useless)). This is nearly an order of magnitude better than the previous world record and approaches the physical limits imposed by quantum mechanics ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=0.000015,with%20the%20computer%27s%20architecture%20and)). The experiment used calcium-43 ions in a bespoke trap and essentially eliminated almost all controllable sources of noise ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=subspace,without)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/scientists-hit-quantum-computer-error-rate-of-0-000015-percent-a-world-record-achievement-that-could-lead-to-smaller-and-faster-machines#:~:text=The%20quantum%20computer%20used%20in,temperature%2C%20which%20the%20researchers%20said)). Such ultra-low error rates point toward future qubits that are intrinsically more stable, reducing the burden on error-correcting codes.

Another intriguing approach is to build qubits that are inherently protected from errors. **Microsoft** has been pursuing **topological qubits** for years, and in early 2025 it claimed a significant advance. Microsoft announced it had created a new material – a so-called *topological superconductor* using indium arsenide and aluminum – that can host **Majorana zero modes**, the exotic quasi-particles needed for topological qubits ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=particules%20de%20Majorana%20afin%20de,fabriqu%C3%A9%20ce%20mat%C3%A9riau%20r%C3%A9volutionnaire%20atome)) ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=fameuses%20particules.%20,ces%20H%20forment%20une%20puce)). They presented a prototype quantum chip nicknamed **“Majorana One,”** which contains 8 topological qubits assembled from networks of these Majorana modes ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L69%20Baptis%C3%A9e%20%C2%AB%C2%A0Majorana,Ce%20que%20le%20groupe)). Each topological qubit (called a “topological core”) is extremely small – roughly 1/100th of a millimeter – which in principle could allow packing **1 million qubits on a hand-sized chip**, according to Microsoft’s engineers ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L69%20Baptis%C3%A9e%20%C2%AB%C2%A0Majorana,Ce%20que%20le%20groupe)) ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=Baptis%C3%A9e%20%C2%AB%C2%A0Majorana%20One%C2%A0%C2%BB%2C%20la%20premi%C3%A8re,Ce%20que%20le%20groupe)). Topological qubits should be far more stable and less error-prone because of the nature of Majorana states (which are immune to many local disturbances) ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L49%20Des%20qubits,seraient%20donc%20moins%20sources%20d%E2%80%99erreur)) ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=Des%20qubits%20construits%20%C3%A0%20partir,seraient%20donc%20moins%20sources%20d%E2%80%99erreur)). Microsoft boldly asserted this could enable a scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computer within ~5–10 years, much sooner than previously thought ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=Microsoft%20a%20jet%C3%A9%2C%20mercredi%2019%C2%A0f%C3%A9vrier%2C,celles%20qu%E2%80%99en%20tirait%20leur%20employeur)) ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=scientifique%20du%20calcul%20quantique,n%E2%80%99a%20pas%20simplifi%C3%A9%20le%20d%C3%A9bat)). However, it’s worth noting that the scientific paper published alongside Microsoft’s claim was more cautious. The study observed some signatures consistent with Majoranas (such as millisecond coherence in certain nanowire devices) but **did not fully prove** the existence of Majorana particles ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=match%20at%20L75%20preuve%20d%E2%80%99avoir,l%E2%80%99ordre%20de%20la%20milliseconde%2C%20soit)). The research is promising – it shows they can fabricate the needed “topoconductor” materials atom-by-atom and measure stable states – but skepticism remains until a definitive Majorana braiding experiment is achieved ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=preuve%20d%E2%80%99avoir%20identifi%C3%A9%20une%20particule,l%E2%80%99ordre%20de%20la%20milliseconde%2C%20soit)) ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=autre%20chose%20qu%E2%80%99une%20Majorana%20ne,c%C3%B4t%C3%A9%20vraisemblable%20et%20la%20preuve)). Nonetheless, Microsoft’s progress suggests a possible path to qubits that inherently suppress errors, complementing the algorithmic QEC advances elsewhere. In summary, 2025 brought **tangible proof that quantum error correction works** on real hardware, alongside novel strategies to make it more efficient. This boosts confidence that scaling to large, reliable quantum computers is only a matter of engineering and time.

## 4. Emerging Practical Applications and Commercial Progress  
Even with current limitations, 2025–2026 has seen the first glimmers of **practical quantum computing applications** delivering real-world results. For decades, quantum computers promised transformative speed-ups “in a few years,” but tangible benefits were elusive. That started to change in 2025, as several projects demonstrated quantum advantage or valuable outcomes on narrowly-defined tasks.

The **strongest proof of quantum advantage** so far came from Google’s **“Quantum Echoes”** experiment. Using the 105-qubit Willow processor, Google ran a specialized algorithm (modeling nuclear magnetic resonance phenomena) that outperformed the world’s fastest classical supercomputers by a factor of **13,000×** ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/googles-quantum-echo-algorithm-shows-worlds-first-practical-application-of-quantum-computing-willow-105-qubit-chip-runs-algorithm-13-000x-faster-than-a-supercomputer#:~:text=,best%20classic%20algorithm%20on%20the)). Crucially, this wasn’t a contrived math problem – it was a meaningful simulation of molecular spin dynamics in an NMR experiment, with results that could be verified for correctness ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/googles-quantum-echo-algorithm-shows-worlds-first-practical-application-of-quantum-computing-willow-105-qubit-chip-runs-algorithm-13-000x-faster-than-a-supercomputer#:~:text=The%20algorithm%20in%20question%20is,are%20reproducible%20and%20were%20checked)). This marked the **first-ever practical application** of a quantum computer that clearly bested classical computing ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/googles-quantum-echo-algorithm-shows-worlds-first-practical-application-of-quantum-computing-willow-105-qubit-chip-runs-algorithm-13-000x-faster-than-a-supercomputer#:~:text=,best%20classic%20algorithm%20on%20the)). Scientists termed it a tipping point: unlike the 2019 “quantum supremacy” experiment (random circuit sampling with no direct practical use), the Quantum Echoes algorithm has scientific and industrial relevance (e.g. in spectroscopy and chemistry) ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/googles-quantum-echo-algorithm-shows-worlds-first-practical-application-of-quantum-computing-willow-105-qubit-chip-runs-algorithm-13-000x-faster-than-a-supercomputer#:~:text=The%20algorithm%20in%20question%20is,are%20reproducible%20and%20were%20checked)). The fact it was **reproducible and verifiable** gave skeptics confidence that the quantum speed-up is real and not a fluke. Google’s success suggests that in certain domains – like simulating quantum physics or complex materials – quantum computers are already becoming the tool of choice.

Quantum computers are also proving their worth in **materials science and chemistry**. As noted, Quantinuum’s Helios machine was used to simulate a **superconducting metal** at the atomic level, leading to the discovery of a new aspect of the material’s behavior ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=The%20scientists%20claim%20this%20is,shy%20about%20that%20at%20all)) ([www.livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/this-is-easily-the-most-powerful-quantum-computer-on-earth-scientists-unveil-helios-a-record-breaking-quantum-system#:~:text=simulate%20a%20superconducting%20metal%20and,of%20computational%20design%20and%20theory)). This kind of quantum simulation could help researchers design novel materials (for batteries, catalysts, etc.) faster than traditional methods. Likewise, QSAR and small-molecule simulations run on IBM and IonQ hardware have reached sizes that challenge classical algorithms, hinting at future *quantum advantage in chemistry*. In one example, researchers used a 16-qubit superconducting processor to model complex chemical reactions and validated the results against experimental data, something conventional computers struggled to do at that scale. These early quantum chemistry applications are still limited (they handle molecules with only dozens of electrons), but they show that **quantum simulation of new compounds and materials** is on the horizon.

One of the most active areas is **optimization problems** – crucial for industries like logistics, finance, and manufacturing. Quantum annealers (like D-Wave’s systems) and gate-model machines running optimization algorithms (like QAOA) have been tested on various real-world use cases. By late 2025, D-Wave reported that its customers and partners had developed “**hundreds of early quantum and hybrid applications**” using its quantum annealing technology ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=quantum%20to%20improve%20public%20services,power%20will%20be%20required%20to)). These include optimizing **transportation routes, supply chain logistics, scheduling, and even emergency response** planning ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=technology,Wave%27s%20technology)) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=computational%20demands%20efficiently,powered%20solutions)). For instance, D-Wave’s quantum optimization was used by Save-On-Foods (a Canadian grocery chain) to optimize delivery truck routes more efficiently, and by a European railroad operator to schedule train maintenance with less downtime. Government agencies in the U.K., Canada, Japan, and Italy have also engaged D-Wave to help solve infrastructure challenges and defense logistics problems ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=keeping%20up%20with%20the%20scale,Fast%20Company%27s%202025%20Next%20Big)) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=smarter%20solutions%20to%20real,system%2C%20a%20powerful%20and%20energy)). According to D-Wave, its newest **Advantage2** annealer can solve certain complex optimization instances in minutes that would take classical methods days, and do so via a cloud service ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=letter%20www,public%20services%20in%20areas%20like)) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=technology,Wave%27s%20technology)). While some skeptics note these claims often involve carefully crafted problem instances, the **value is real** – companies have started getting better solutions or faster run-times on practical tasks by incorporating quantum routines. The key is often a hybrid approach: using a quantum solver for the hard core of a problem and classical computers for pre- and post-processing. This hybrid quantum-classical strategy is yielding benefits **today**, bridging the gap until fully error-corrected gate-model quantum computers can tackle these problems natively ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=quantum%20to%20improve%20public%20services,power%20will%20be%20required%20to)) ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=built%20with%20D,sectors%20from%20logistics%20to%20defense)). Alan Baratz, D-Wave’s CEO, even wrote a public letter countering the “quantum is always decades away” narrative, pointing out that *real value is already being delivered* in optimization and urging industries to get on board now ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/sponsored/how-d-wavetm-is-solving-complex-government-challenges-today#:~:text=quantum%20computing%20,logistics%20firms%20and%20retailers%20alike)).

In the **financial sector**, quantum computing has made inroads via pilot projects. A notable example came in 2025 when global bank **HSBC** announced a breakthrough using an IBM quantum processor to optimize bond trading strategies ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/26/ai-hsbc-quantum-bonds#:~:text=The%20global%20bank%20HSBC%20has,jobs%20away%20from%20people%2C%20Philip)). In a live trial, HSBC used IBM’s advanced 127-qubit processor to analyze bond yield datasets, and it achieved a **34% improvement** in predicting bond prices compared to traditional techniques ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/26/ai-hsbc-quantum-bonds#:~:text=The%20global%20bank%20HSBC%20has,jobs%20away%20from%20people%2C%20Philip)). This is a remarkable boost in a field where single-percentage improvements can be worth millions. HSBC’s quantum team said it was the first-ever use of quantum computing for a trading optimization task, potentially foreshadowing a new tech-driven era on Wall Street ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2025/09/26/ai-hsbc-quantum-bonds#:~:text=The%20global%20bank%20HSBC%20has,jobs%20away%20from%20people%2C%20Philip)). Other banks and financial firms (JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, etc.) have also been exploring quantum algorithms for portfolio optimization, risk analysis, and option pricing. For example, JPMorgan has tested quantum-based Monte Carlo simulations for option pricing that converge with fewer samples than classical Monte Carlo, under quantum error-mitigation techniques. While full “quantum finance” hasn’t arrived, these trials demonstrate **concrete advantages in speed or accuracy** on specific financial analytics when a quantum subroutine is employed.

**Machine learning** is another emerging application area. Researchers have begun deploying small quantum circuits within classical ML workflows – for instance, using quantum computers to generate better training data or to optimize certain model parameters. In 2025, several studies showed that quantum kernel methods and variational algorithms could classify datasets or detect patterns with accuracy rivaling classical ML, albeit on small data sizes. A headline-grabbing claim from China was that a photonic quantum computer performed **AI image recognition tasks faster than GPUs**, though details were scarce and this remains to be verified independently ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/new-chinese-optical-quantum-chip-allegedly-1-000x-faster-than-nvidia-gpus-for-processing-ai-workloads-but-yields-are-low#:~:text=%22industrial,a%20monolithic%20design%2C%20making%20them)). Still, companies like Google and IBM are actively researching **quantum machine learning (QML)**, envisioning hybrid systems where quantum processors could handle parts of a neural network or rapidly calculate kernel functions in high-dimensional spaces. Early results in QML are mostly experimental, but they point toward quantum accelerating certain subroutines of AI in the near future.

Finally, some quantum applications are already **commercial products**. Quantum-based random number generators (QRNGs) are sold by companies like ID Quantique and Quantinuum, providing true randomness for cryptography. Quantum sensors (while a separate technology domain) are also making strides, but those are beyond the scope of quantum *computing* per se. It’s worth noting, however, that the rise of quantum computers is influencing other sectors – for example, the push for **post-quantum cryptography** (to secure data against future quantum decryption) is well underway, with standards being finalized for quantum-resistant encryption algorithms.

Looking at the broad picture, **useful applications of quantum computing are emerging in niches**: complex optimization, quantum simulation for materials/chemistry, and certain financial modeling tasks have shown real results. Industry roadmaps indicate this is just the beginning. IBM, for instance, stated in late 2025 that they anticipate significant ROI for quantum computing across industries (from pharma to finance) within **3–5 years**, as quantum hardware and algorithms continue to improve ([www.itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/technology/big-data/ibm-is-targeting-quantum-advantage-in-12-months-and-says-useful-quantum-computing-is-just-a-few-years-away#:~:text=IBM%20predicts%20it%20will%20reach,quantum%20computing%20for%20decades%2C%20but)). IBM expects to reach the **“quantum advantage”** milestone (practical benefits over classical computing) by 2026 ([www.itpro.com](https://www.itpro.com/technology/big-data/ibm-is-targeting-quantum-advantage-in-12-months-and-says-useful-quantum-computing-is-just-a-few-years-away#:~:text=IBM%20predicts%20it%20will%20reach,quantum%20computing%20for%20decades%2C%20but)), echoing similar optimism from Google and others. To prepare, companies worldwide – Bosch in automotive, Airbus in aerospace, Dow in chemicals, to name a few – have partnered with quantum firms on pilot projects. While large-scale impact is still a few years out, the **trend in 2025–2026 is clear**: quantum computing is transitioning from pure research to a nascent industry, delivering early value in specific areas and rapidly expanding its reach.

## Industry and Funding Trends  
The accelerating progress in quantum computing has been fueled by a flood of **investment and government support** in recent years. In 2025 alone, venture capital and corporate funding for quantum startups hit record levels. The year’s largest deal was PsiQuantum’s **$1 billion Series E** round to build a photonic quantum computer, one of the biggest single investments in quantum tech to date ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/psiquantum-plans-to-build-worlds-first-large-scale-fault-tolerant-million-qubit-quantum-computers-for-solving-some-of-the-worlds-most-complex-scientific-problems#:~:text=Date%3A%20Tue%20Sep%2016%2000%3A29%3A00,2025%20UTC)) ([www.techradar.com](https://www.techradar.com/pro/psiquantum-plans-to-build-worlds-first-large-scale-fault-tolerant-million-qubit-quantum-computers-for-solving-some-of-the-worlds-most-complex-scientific-problems#:~:text=PsiQuantum%20has%20announced%20that%20it,its%20approach%20on%20photonic%20qubits)). Several other startups secured major funding: e.g. **Quantum Machines** (quantum control electronics) raised $70 million, **Q-CTRL** (error mitigation software) raised $27 million, and **Alice & Bob** (France, superconducting cat qubits) raised €27 million, to name a few. Public markets showed interest as well – IonQ, which went public via SPAC in 2021, saw its stock surge in 2023–2024 as it hit technical milestones (though it remains volatile). In May 2025, shares of D-Wave (also a publicly traded company) spiked 130% over two weeks after it announced the commercial availability of its Advantage2 system ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2025-05-20/la-empresa-de-computacion-cuantica-d-wave-quantum-se-dispara-en-bolsa-tras-poner-a-la-venta-su-nuevo-superordenador.html#:~:text=Las%20acciones%20de%20la%20empresa,La%20cifra%20de%20ingresos)) ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2025-05-20/la-empresa-de-computacion-cuantica-d-wave-quantum-se-dispara-en-bolsa-tras-poner-a-la-venta-su-nuevo-superordenador.html#:~:text=un%2025,est%C3%A1%20experimentando%20este%20martes%2C%20el)). Despite being a small company with modest revenue (~$15 M in Q1 2025) and ongoing losses, D-Wave’s market cap briefly exceeded $4.5 billion on investor excitement ([cincodias.elpais.com](https://cincodias.elpais.com/companias/2025-05-20/la-empresa-de-computacion-cuantica-d-wave-quantum-se-dispara-en-bolsa-tras-poner-a-la-venta-su-nuevo-superordenador.html#:~:text=A%20pesar%20de%20la%20fuerte,esas%20tecnolog%C3%ADas%20prometedoras%20que%2C%20de)). This reflects a broader optimism in the sector’s growth potential.

**Big tech companies** are also investing heavily from their own coffers. IBM and Google each have hundreds of researchers and engineers devoted to quantum R&D and have outlined detailed roadmaps through the end of the decade. Amazon and Microsoft, while pursuing different approaches (Microsoft with topological qubits, Amazon with a multi-pronged research program and cloud services), have also increased funding. Microsoft, for example, in 2025 ramped up its quantum lab in Santa Barbara and announced plans to **commercialize a fault-tolerant quantum computer within ~5–10 years**, far sooner than its previous estimates ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=Microsoft%20a%20jet%C3%A9%2C%20mercredi%2019%C2%A0f%C3%A9vrier%2C,celles%20qu%E2%80%99en%20tirait%20leur%20employeur)) ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2025/02/21/ordinateurs-quantiques-microsoft-jette-un-pave-dans-la-mare_6557701_1650684.html#:~:text=scientifique%20du%20calcul%20quantique,n%E2%80%99a%20pas%20simplifi%C3%A9%20le%20d%C3%A9bat)). NVIDIA, not wanting to be left out, launched the CUDA Quantum platform and is exploring quantum circuit simulation on GPUs, as well as potential hybrid quantum/classical computing architectures.

On the **government side**, spending has grown worldwide. In the United States, Congress is moving to reauthorize the National Quantum Initiative (NQI) Act for another 5 years (2024–2029) to ensure continued federal support for quantum research ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/08/senators-unveil-bipartisan-quantum-bill#:~:text=Sens.%20Todd%20Young%20%28R,centers%20at%20some%20of%20the)). A bipartisan bill introduced in January 2026 would renew funding for NQI programs across NSF, NIST, DOE, and NASA, and establish new quantum research centers ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/08/senators-unveil-bipartisan-quantum-bill#:~:text=Sens.%20Todd%20Young%20%28R,at%20some%20of%20the%20agencies)). Lawmakers stress that investing in quantum is vital for scientific breakthroughs and for the U.S. to “outcompete China” in this strategic technology ([www.axios.com](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/08/senators-unveil-bipartisan-quantum-bill#:~:text=agencies.%20What%20they%27re%20saying%3A%20,to%20include%20comment%20from%20IBM)). The U.S. CHIPS and Science Act (2022) also allocated substantial resources to quantum; indeed, there are reports that tens of millions of CHIPS Act dollars may be directly invested in leading quantum companies (such as Atom Computing or D-Wave) in exchange for equity stakes ([www.tomshardware.com](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/quantum-computing/trump-administration-to-follow-up-intel-stake-with-investment-in-quantum-computing-report-claims-tens-of-millions-of-chips-act-dollars-could-be-paid-out-to-leading-companies-in-exchange-for-equity#:~:text=2025,Wave)). Europe, meanwhile, continues its **Quantum Flagship** program (a €1 billion initiative over 10 years) and is formulating a coordinated **“EU Quantum Chips Act.”** In early 2025, EU officials discussed a strategic plan to boost Europe’s quantum hardware industry and reduce reliance on non-European tech ([www.lemonde.fr](https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2025/03/02/puces-quantiques-l-europe-prepare-son-quantum-act-pour-reglementer-le-secteur_6572889_3234.html#:~:text=2025,Chips%20Plan%20%C2%BB%2C%20%C3%A0%20pr%C3%A9senter)). Individual European countries have launched sizable programs: for instance, **Germany** committed €2 billion for quantum research and industry in 2021, **France** €1.8 billion, and the **UK** announced £2.5 billion (~$3.5 B) over 10 years for quantum technologies in 2023. By 2025, Spain built its first homegrown quantum computer (with 5 qubits, via startup Qilimanjaro) with €9 million in government funding ([elpais.com](https://elpais.com/espana/catalunya/2025-02-06/el-barcelona-supercomputing-center-presenta-el-primer-ordenador-cuantico-de-espana-con-tecnologia-unicamente-europea.html#:~:text=2025,financiaci%C3%B3n%20por%20parte%20de%20Quantum)), and also invested nearly €10 M to attract a quantum startup (Nu Quantum) to establish a local presence ([elpais.com](https://elpais.com/tecnologia/2026-01-28/espana-invierte-10-millones-de-euros-en-nu-quantum-una-tecnologica-pionera-en-conexion-de-procesadores-cuanticos.html#:~:text=2026,Esta%20iniciativa%20est%C3%A1)). Across Asia, **China** is estimated to have poured the equivalent of several billion dollars into quantum research (including a $10 B National Laboratory in Hefei). **Japan** and **South Korea** have national programs in the hundreds of millions, and **Canada** continues strong support through its National Quantum Strategy ($360 M announced in 2022) as well as provincial initiatives.

Global competition in quantum computing is clearly heating up. Governments view quantum tech as both an economic opportunity and a national security imperative. This is driving collaborative projects (for example, U.S. and Japan launched a quantum computing partnership, and Europe is funding cross-border quantum testbeds) as well as a healthy rivalry to achieve quantum advantages first. The influx of funding is accelerating research and also helping to **build a quantum workforce**, with universities expanding quantum engineering programs to train new talent.

In summary, **2025–2026 has been a pivotal period** for quantum computing. Hardware milestones (100+ qubit chips, high-coherence materials, novel architectures) and error-correction breakthroughs are arriving hand-in-hand with the **first real commercial use cases**. Industry leaders are optimistic that within the next few years we will routinely see quantum computers tackling valuable problems beyond the reach of classical HPC. Thanks to robust funding and a growing ecosystem of quantum startups, the field is moving from laboratory curiosity toward practical technology. Challenges remain – scaling from ~100 qubits to the millions likely needed, further reducing error rates, and developing software and algorithms for new quantum hardware – but the progress to date has been remarkable. If the current trajectory continues, the latter half of the 2020s could finally usher in the long-promised **quantum revolution**, where quantum computation becomes an everyday tool for science and industry. The groundwork laid by the milestones, players, and applications highlighted above suggests that quantum computing’s transformative impact is drawing ever nearer.

These developments collectively paint the picture of a field rapidly advancing on all fronts toward practical, error-corrected quantum computers.
