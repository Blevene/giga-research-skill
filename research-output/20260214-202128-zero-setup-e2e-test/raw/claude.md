# History of the ACM Turing Award: A Brief Overview

## Introduction



The ACM A. M. Turing Award is an annual prize given by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for contributions of lasting and major technical importance to computer science.

 

It is generally recognized as the highest distinction in the field of computer science and is often referred to as the "Nobel Prize of Computing".

 Named after Alan Turing, the British mathematician who laid the mathematical foundations of computing and played a pivotal role in breaking the Enigma cipher during World War II, this award represents the pinnacle of achievement in computer science.

## 1. When Was the Turing Award Established and By Whom?



Since its inception in 1966, the Turing Award has honored the computer scientists and engineers who created the systems and underlying theoretical foundations that have propelled the information technology industry.

 The award was established by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), 

a professional computing society founded in 1947

, to recognize groundbreaking contributions to the field.



The award is named after Alan Turing, also referred as "Father of Computer Science", who was a British mathematician and reader in mathematics at the University of Manchester.

 

The A.M. Turing Award is named for Alan Mathison Turing (1912-1954), the British mathematician and computer scientist who articulated the mathematical foundation and limits of computing, and who was a key contributor to the Allied cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher during World War II.

 By commemorating Turing's legacy, the ACM sought to establish a tradition of recognizing transformative work in computing that would inspire future generations of computer scientists.

## 2. Who Were the First Three Recipients and What Were Their Contributions?

### Alan J. Perlis (1966)



The first recipient, in 1966, was Alan Perlis, an American computer scientist who wrote the compiler for the ALGOL computer programming language.

 

He was awarded the inaugural Turing Award in 1966, according to the citation, "for his influence in the area of advanced programming techniques and compiler construction."



Perlis's contributions extended far beyond compiler construction. 

In the mid-1950s, Perlis began to design the IT (Internal Translator) compiler at Purdue and he completed the project after moving to Carnegie Institute of Technology. As chair of the Association for Computer Machinery committee charged to develop a common universal programming language in 1957, he worked to create ALGOL.

 

Arguably one of the most influential programming languages in history, ALGOL-60 had a very complex and controversial history in its early years.

 His leadership in shaping computer science as an academic discipline was equally significant; 

Perlis' leadership in helping to mold the nascent field of Computer Science into an academic discipline was particularly relevant, with the establishment of the ACM Curriculum Committee on Computer Science during Perlis' term as President of the ACM (1962-1964).



### Maurice V. Wilkes (1967)



Professor Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. Built in 1949, the EDSAC used a mercury delay line memory.

 

The machine sprang to life on May 6, 1949, the world's first practical electronic computer.



Wilkes's contributions went beyond hardware design. 

He is also known as the author, with David Wheeler and Stanley Gill, of a volume on Preparation of Programs for Electronic Digital Computers in 1951, in which program libraries were effectively introduced.

 Perhaps his most enduring theoretical contribution was microprogramming. 

Wilkes came up with a new design principle -- which he called microprogramming—that greatly simplified the logical design of the new computer. Microprogramming was Wilkes' most important scientific contribution to computing, and had he done nothing else he would be famous for that.

 

In the early 1960s IBM based its world beating System/360 computers around the idea, and it remains a cornerstone of computer architecture.



### Richard W. Hamming (1968)



For his work, he received the ACM Turing Award in 1968, being its third recipient.

 

For his work on numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes.



Hamming's most famous contribution was the development of error-correcting codes. 

His contributions include the Hamming code (which makes use of a Hamming matrix), the Hamming window, Hamming numbers, sphere-packing (or Hamming bound), Hamming graph concepts, and the Hamming distance.

 Working at Bell Telephone Laboratories alongside Claude Shannon, 

Richard Hamming's classic paper Error detecting and error correcting codes appeared in April 1950 in the Bell System Technical Journal.

 His codes enabled computers to automatically detect and correct transmission errors, laying the groundwork for reliable digital communication. These contributions remain fundamental to modern computing and telecommunications, from spacecraft communications to data storage systems.

## 3. What Is the Current Prize Amount?

The financial recognition accompanying the Turing Award has evolved significantly over its history. Initially, the award carried no monetary prize. 

Intel Corporation began funding the Turing Award in 2002, and in 2007 Google Inc. joined in funding the award.

 

The prize money was raised to $250,000 that year and then to $1,000,000 in 2014.





The ACM A.M. Turing Award, often referred to as the "Nobel Prize in Computing," carries a $1 million prize with financial support provided by Google, Inc.

 This substantial prize places the Turing Award on par with other major international scientific awards and reflects the profound impact that computing has had on modern society. The million-dollar prize level has been maintained through 2024, with 

the most recent recipients being Andrew Barto and Richard S. Sutton, who won in 2024

 for their pioneering work on reinforcement learning.

## Conclusion

The ACM Turing Award has successfully fulfilled its mission of recognizing transformative contributions to computer science for nearly six decades. From Alan Perlis's work on programming languages and compilers, to Maurice Wilkes's development of the first practical stored-program computer and invention of microprogramming, to Richard Hamming's error-correcting codes, the award's first three recipients set a high standard for excellence that continues today. 

As of 2025, 79 people have been awarded the prize

, each contributing to the rich tapestry of innovations that have shaped our digital world. The award stands as both a celebration of past achievements and an inspiration for future breakthroughs in computing.
