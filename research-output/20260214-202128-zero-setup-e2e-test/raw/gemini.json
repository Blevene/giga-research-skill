Turing Award is universally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, frequently referred to as the \"Nobel Prize of Computing.\" Presented annually by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), the award honors individuals whose technical contributions to the field have been of lasting and major importance. The prize is named after Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician whose work laid the theoretical foundations for modern computing and artificial intelligence [cite: 1, 2].\n\n## Establishment and Purpose\nThe Turing Award was established in 1966 by the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [cite: 1, 3]. The ACM, founded in 1947 as a scientific and educational society, created the award to recognize and encourage outstanding contributions to the computing community. It was named in honor of Alan Mathison Turing (1912–1954), a visionary mathematician and cryptanalyst who is credited with articulating the mathematical foundation and limits of computing, particularly through his conceptualization of the \"Turing machine\" and his work on the Enigma cipher during World War II [cite: 2, 4].\n\nThe primary purpose of the award is to celebrate those who have propelled the information technology industry through the creation of systems and underlying theoretical foundations. The selection process is rigorous, aiming to identify contributions that are not only technically significant but also possess \"lasting importance\" to the field [cite: 5]. As of 2025, the award has been presented to 79 individuals, comprising a diverse group of pioneers responsible for the internet's architecture, database systems, artificial intelligence, and compiler optimization [cite: 1, 5].\n\n## The First Three Recipients\nThe first three recipients of the Turing Award set a high standard for the prestige of the honor, representing foundational work in programming languages, hardware architecture, and error correction.\n\n1.  **1966: Alan J. Perlis.** The inaugural award was presented to Alan Perlis, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University (and later Yale). His citation honored his \"influence in the area of advanced programming techniques and compiler construction\" [cite: 6, 7]. Perlis was a key figure in the development of the ALGOL programming language and is credited with work on one of the first successful compilers, the Internal Translator (IT) [cite: 6].\n2.  **1967: Maurice V. Wilkes.** The second award went to British computer scientist Maurice Wilkes. He was cited as the \"builder and designer of the EDSAC,\" which was the first computer with an internally stored program to see practical use [cite: 8, 9]. Additionally, the citation recognized his authorship (with Wheeler and Gill) of the 1951 volume *Preparation of Programs for Electronic Digital Computers*, which effectively introduced the concept of program libraries [cite: 10, 11].\n3.  **1968: Richard Hamming.** The third recipient was Richard W. Hamming, a mathematician at Bell Labs. He was honored for his work on \"numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes\" [cite: 12, 13]. His contributions, such as Hamming codes and the Hamming distance, created an entirely new field within information theory and remain fundamental to modern computer reliability and telecommunications [cite: 14, 15].\n\n## Current Prize Amount\nSince 2014, the Turing Award has carried a monetary prize of **$1 million USD** [cite: 16]. This significant increase from the previous level of $250,000 was funded by Google to elevate the award's visibility and place it on a financial par with prestigious cultural and scientific honors like the Nobel Prize [cite: 17, 18]. Prior to 2014, the financial support was provided jointly by Intel and Google, but Intel ended its contribution that year, leaving Google as the sole sponsor of the cash prize [cite: 1, 19].\n\n**Sources:**\n1.
