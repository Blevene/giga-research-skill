# History of the Turing Award

## Origin and Purpose 
The **Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)** established the Turing Award in **1966**, naming it in honor of Alan M. Turing, the British mathematician and computing pioneer ([www.britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Turing-Award#:~:text=The%20Turing%20Award%20is%20named,computer%20scientist%20who%20wrote%20the)). This annual award recognizes individuals for **lasting and major technical contributions to computer science** and is widely regarded as the “**Nobel Prize of computing**” ([www.britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Turing-Award#:~:text=Turing%20Award%2C%20annual%20award%20given,equivalent%20of%20the%20Nobel%20Prize)). Its creation reflected ACM’s intent to celebrate groundbreaking achievements in the nascent field of computing and to **honor Turing’s legacy** as a founder of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. 

## First Three Recipients and Their Contributions 
The first three Turing Award recipients set the standard for the award by showcasing diverse fundamental contributions to the field:

- **Alan J. Perlis (1966):** An American computer scientist, Perlis became the inaugural Turing Award laureate for his influence on **advanced programming techniques** and **compiler construction** ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis#:~:text=He%20was%20awarded%20the%20inaugural,23%20as%20the%20first)). He notably wrote the compiler for the ALGOL programming language, reflecting his pioneering work in programming language design.  
- **Maurice V. Wilkes (1967):** A British computer scientist, Wilkes was honored as the second Turing Award winner. He designed and built **EDSAC** (1949), one of the earliest stored-program computers, and **invented microprogramming** – a method for controlling a CPU’s operations – which laid important groundwork for modern computer architecture ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Wilkes#:~:text=Sir%20Maurice%20Vincent%20Wilkes%20,at%20the%20%207)).  
- **Richard Hamming (1968):** An American mathematician and computing theorist, Hamming received the third Turing Award for his foundational work in computer science, including developing **error-detecting and error-correcting codes** (known as **Hamming codes**) that improve the reliability of data transmission ([www.britannica.com](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Turing-Award#:~:text=,error%20detection%20and%20error%20correction)). His contributions to numerical methods and information theory helped enable more robust computing and communications systems.

## Current Prize Amount 
Today, the ACM Turing Award carries a substantial **monetary prize**. **Since 2014, the award has been accompanied by a \$1 million USD cash prize**, thanks to financial support from Google ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award#:~:text=contributor%20to%20the%20Allied%20cryptanalysis,financial%20support%20provided%20by%20Google)). This prize amount—significantly increased from earlier years—underscores the award’s prestige and the value placed on computing innovations that have global impact.
